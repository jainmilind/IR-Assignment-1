    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is a technique used to evaluate the importance of words in a document or corpus. It measures the frequency of a word in a document (TF) and the importance of a word in a corpus (IDF). The score for a word is obtained by multiplying its TF and IDF values. This method is widely used in information retrieval systems to rank documents by relevance to a query."

    "The TF-IDF scoring algorithm calculates a score for each term in the query and each document in the collection, using the following formula:\n",

    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF score for each term in the query is calculated in the same way. Then, for each document, the algorithm calculates the dot product between the query's TF-IDF scores and the document's TF-IDF scores. The resulting score represents the relevance of the document to the query string.\n",

    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank_docs_by_tfidf function is a Python implementation of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm used for ranking documents based on their relevance to a given query string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes a query string as input and returns a list of document IDs that are ranked in descending order of their relevance to the query. The algorithm first processes the query string by removing stop words and stem each term using a stemming algorithm to reduce them to their root forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the algorithm calculates the TF-IDF score for each term in the query. It multiplies the term frequency in the query with the inverse document frequency (IDF) of the term. For each document that contains the term, it multiplies the document's TF-IDF score with the query's TF-IDF score for that term and adds the result to the document's score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the algorithm returns a list of document IDs sorted in descending order of their scores. This allows the user to quickly identify the documents that are most relevant to the query string."
