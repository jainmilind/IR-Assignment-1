it to us we may at our absolute discretion avoid the policy and refuse to pay any claims where any failure to make a fair presentation is deliberate or reckless or of such other nature that if you had made a fair presentation we would not have issued the policy we will return the premium paid by you unless the failure to make a fair presentation is deliberate or reckless if we would have issued the policy on different terms had you made a fair presentation we will not avoid the policy except where the failure is deliberate or reckless but we may instead at our absolute discretion reduce proportionately the amount paid or payable on any claim the proportion for which we are liable being calculated by comparing the premium actually charged as a percentage of the premium which we would have charged had you made a fair presentation and or treat the policy as if it had included such additional terms other than those requiring payment of the premium as we would have imposed had you made a fair presentation for the purposes of this condition references to avoiding a policy means treating the policy as if it had not existed from the inception date ( where the failure to make a fair presentation of the risk occurs before the inception of the policy ) the renewal date ( where the failure occurs at renewal of the policy ) or the date of change ( where the failure occurs when the policy is changed ) refunds of premium should be treated as refunds of premium back to the inception date renewal date or date of change as the context requires issuing a policy should be treated as the references to issuing the policy at inception renewing or change of the policy as the context requires premium should be treated as the premium payable for the particular contract of insurance which is subject to this condition where there is more than one contract of insurance reasonable care if in relation to any claim you have failed to fulfil any of the following conditions you will
