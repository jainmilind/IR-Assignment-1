    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-gram model is a type of neural network architecture that is commonly used for word embedding. It is a form of unsupervised learning that aims to learn the distributional representation of words.The basic idea behind skip-gram model is to predict the context words surrounding a given target word, rather than predicting the target word from the context words. The context words are defined as the words that occur within a certain window of the target word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skip-gram model consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer represents the target word, and the output layer represents the context words. The hidden layer is used to transform the input word into a distributed representation, or embedding, which is used to predict the context words.During training, the skip-gram model is fed with a large corpus of text. For each target word in the corpus, a training example is created by randomly selecting one of its context words as the output, and setting the remaining context words as inputs to the model. The model is then trained to predict the output context word given the input context words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process involves adjusting the weights of the model to minimize the difference between the predicted context word and the actual context word. The weights are adjusted using backpropagation algorithm, which updates the weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual output.After training, the skip-gram model generates a dense vector representation for each word in the vocabulary. The vector representation captures the semantic and syntactic information of the word, and can be used as input to other machine learning models for various natural language processing tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and machine translation."

    "The following code initializes an empty list called data, which will be used to store the tokenized and preprocessed documents. Then, it loops over each document in the documents list and tokenizes each sentence into a list of words. Each word is then converted to lowercase and added to a temporary list called temp. The temp list is then appended to the data list, which now contains a list of tokenized and preprocessed documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the Word2Vec model from the gensim library is used to train a word embedding model on the data list. The min_count parameter specifies the minimum frequency count of a word in the corpus for it to be included in the model. The vector_size parameter specifies the dimensionality of the word vectors. The window parameter specifies the maximum distance between the target word and the context word within a sentence. The sg parameter specifies the training algorithm to be used - 1 for skip-gram and 0 for CBOW. In this case, sg is set to 1 which corresponds to the skip-gram algorithm for training.\n",
