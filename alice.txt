Hi Team, I just recently upgraded our cucumber-jvm version ever since then I am getting following error 
Exception in thread \main\ java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: cucumber.runtime.Glue.removeScenarioScopedGlue()V\n\tat cucumber.runtime.java.JavaBackend.buildWorld(JavaBackend.java:131)
@amit007 looks like you have inconsistent cucumber-* jar versions
So github is trying to replace irc :P
@aslakhellesoy Thanks , seems like I was using older version of cucumber-core , updated the maven with specific version and things started working 
Hi all! I have one question. With friends we are starting some project on studies. And we would like to write tests in cucumber. Can anybody say how we should start?
@Danon9111  You should integrate Cucumber with another testing framework which can allow you use some APIs to write Test scripts and execute them on the System Under test (Like Appium or Calabash) ... see this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDV1p-byVeE
@aslakhellesoy  ... When reading \ The Cucumber Book\ i found the code below in Ruby . there is any way to convert it to Java ? \n-----------\nCode : \nGiven /^an activated customer (\\w+) exists$/ do |name|\nsteps %{\nGiven I create a customer with login #{name}\nAnd I register the customer with login #{name}\nAnd I activate the customer with login #{name}\n}\nend 
@Sidkiyassine just call the methods directly!
I had intergrated cucumber+appium https://github.com/priyankshah217/AppiumCucumberTest
@Sidkiyassine  i think you dont need to write annotations manually, it will be taken care if you run feature using cucumber test runner
Hello guys, need a help.I want to call the run my featute file by calling the cucumber.cli.Main form a java class by passing the the parameters like tags ,format..I its possible.I don want to use cucumber options as I have to pass the tag name s as a variable ...
Hello guys,\nIs it possible to get  test coverage using jacoco for android tests?\ndefaultConfig {\n              testInstrumentationRunner \cucumber.api.android.CucumberInstrumentation\\n    }
hey everyone, can someone help me out with running a feature file with specific tags included and excluded?
say i want to run tags @Android but not @IOS
mvn clean test -Dspring.profiles.active=ios -Dcucumber.options=\src/test/resources/com/mttnow/steps --tags @Settings, ~@Android\\n\nfor example i have a spring profile for ios, and i want to run settings tag but exclude all  tags @Android
and the above doesnt seem to work :(
got my answer here http://xebee.xebia.in/index.php/2015/01/23/cucumber-jvm-all-you-need-to-know-about-tags-and-hooks/
@aslakhellesoy: my fault for not putting it in the History :D
@dkowis no worries. Any thoughts about the java8 approach to instantiate new scala stepdefs for each scenario?
I haven't looked at it, tbh
is the ruby way different?
or does it create a new object every time also?
since stuff in a scala class ends up in the constructor of that object
I think, but it's been a while since I did ruby cucumbers, that objects created in ruby stepdefs files not inside of a Before aren't re-initialized every time
is that assumption correct?
I can probably make the scala objects behave more like java objects
and probably should since the java8 lamdas are doing it
so yeah, I'll probably do that eventually
hey everyone, is it possible to run only a subset of examples in a table for scenario outline?
@Simon-Kaz yes, just specify the line numbers. `mvn test -Dcucumber.options=\src/test/resources/awesome.feature:44:45:46\`
is it possible to tag specific table entries instead?
say i have a table of 20 tests.. and i want to run just one for @sanitySuite and all for @regressionSuite 
id then tag the single entry with @sanitySuite 
@Simon-Kaz yes, you can have several Examples blocks (with tables) underneath a Scenario Outline, and each Examples block can be tagged.
ah, interesting. Ill play around with this :)
is that what you meant? https://gist.github.com/Simon-Kaz/7329a2493d1557e84d3a
Yes that's it
I got some feedback this week in training about the automatic casting of DataTables into lists of value objects.
1) it doesn\u2019t seem to call the constructor, or even instanciate final fields, which is a bit of a pain
2) there doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to use transforms in conjunction with it (I don\u2019t really understand how transforms work on Cucumber JVM but that\u2019s what people told me) which would help give you more flexibility
3) you can\u2019t use column headers in the Gherkin doc because that row will just be turned into one of the value objects in the list
Seems a bit weak to me. It\u2019s a shame we haven\u2019t had any PRs about this, but I guess a lot of our enterprisey users just don\u2019t consider doing that (or aren\u2019t allowed to while at work)
@aslakhellesoy @brasmusson thoughts?
cucumber  have support for spring3? 
They have thought to support version 3.0.x?
I working in one branch for support for this version
https://github.com/Miuler/cucumber-jvm/tree/hg/spring3
But, I do not know how to make coexist the two versions, one for 3 and another for 4 in the same trunk, without duplicate code.
exist some rason for the dependencies the spring are within pom.xml parent?
because not within the submodule spring?
@mattwynne re: calling constructors - that's right. Added a ticket: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/888
@mattwynne the best advice I have is to tell people to start a discussion or create an issue.
Regarding 3 - I suppose we could add logic to omit the header row if (and only if) the first row matches the fields of the list type.
Again - would need a ticket in order to prioritise this. If there is no ticket the problem doesn't exist.
@Miuler the best way to add spring3 support would be to duplicate the code from spring (Spring 4) and tweak that. It's not that much code, and we can live with the duplication.
The reason the versions are defined in the parent pom is to make it easier for maintainers to bump versions - it's all in one place.
Also, there is an example project in examples/spring-txn that uses the same version. Having it in the parent means we don't need to worry about versions getting out of sync
open question lads, when re-running failing tests is there by any chance a way to merge previous rusult of failing tests with the one that has been re-run , for example, if I have 3 tests, a, b and c, and test b failed, so I will re-run it, the cucumber report will display only the result of test b not a,b and c
id assume that you should be able to merge them. Should be pretty simple if you use the json reports and merge all into HTML 
its something ive been planning to do as well, let me know if you make any progress :)
@nablik if you re-run tests and they pass, I assume you've changed something to make them pass. Wouldn't that invalidate the previous test results?
@aslakhellesoy : I have cases where the tests fail,  and pass in the second run. \nI have a UI that displays data retrieved from service.  Some time where the data is not cached, the UI will display nothing because it takes longer to load it than authorised.  there is no issue here because once the cache is populated the symptoms is gone(and the scond call will get the required data). \nThere is no business impact and no user experience impact. So re-run the test is enough in my case at 98% to confirm that the test is green.  
same situation here, i have to rely on external service to populate the data, im unable to mock it myself
@Simon-Kaz your tests are trying to tell you something. They are trying to tell you your design is too tightly coupled to this external service.
What's the value of a test result if the tests fail intermittently and have to be run several times in order to pass?
@Simon-Kaz have you considered adopting a ports and adapters design so you can test without depending on external services you don't control?
@nablik so what exactly are you testing? That you can retrieve the data from the 3rd party service? That you\u2019re displaying it properly? Testing both of those in the same test is very inefficient. I\u2019d split that up in independent tests.
@aslakhellesoy : My question here is not how to test or not. I have tests that cover each module separately. This one is more end to end test, in integration level. However, my question is related to merging 2 cucumber report into one instead of overwriting it. 
im testing a mobile app that uses clients b2b server to fetch the data
I've looked into mocking the data, but its not an option at this time
unrelated question - is it possible to add more than 1 step definition to a method? I mean, when the text of the step changes a little, i dont want to create a new step definition, i want to reuse the existing one.  I think the equivalent of this is the @Alias annotation in jBehave
i found a discussion on this topic but i cant find any resolution to it https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/cukes/alias$20jbehave/cukes/enPlH3xut2E/Z-KyVl18ytwJ
Think it is a great frature request  if this is not in there already - I ve personally felt a need for this as well
not a lot of duplication but if we have an additional method defined somewhere that does all the work
Given /^I have (\\d+) cucumbers in my belly$/ do |cukes|\nend
Given /^I have (\\d+) cucumbers in my belly-- this is an alias $/ do |cukes|\nend
both these step defs can call (myUtilClass).mycommonMethod
Hi. I'm using cucumber-scala. When running it's producing stubs for both java and scala. Is there an option to limit this to scala only? Thanks.
@ldeck do you have cucumber-java on your classpath? remove it?
@aslakhellesoy  yes, removing cucumber-java from the classpath fixes that issue. Thanks. 
Hi, I am trying to run my test, but I can only see that my first test is running, but my second step in the steps definitions is not being executed, plz help, thanks
Has anyone had any joy using cucumber-jvm to  allow bdd of a  Netbeans Platform App? Or am I barking up the wrong tree?
i have a query.. i have multiple feature files but all definations dump into single step defination file.
now problem is that i want to make multiple step defination files.. but here i did not find any way to share variable between two step defs... 
the work around would be i need to pass variables to each function call which i guess really bad approach
is there any possiblity to simplefy this using DI??
@priyankshah217 yes, DI will help you with this
is it possible to skip a test during it's execution if a certain condition has been met?
as in, end the scenario but rather than fail it, mark it as skipped
@Simon-Kaz you mean skip a scenario?
No, there is no way to do that currently. What do you need it for?
its a crappy situation really
i have an external service that SOMETIMES is down (too often for my taste)
i can only verify that during a test
so rather than fail a test because the service is down, id like to skip that test 
I wouldn\u2019t use Cucumber in that environment
Instead I\u2019d make your app talk to a stub adapter for the external service, and use unit tests to verify that the production adapter for the external service works.
yeah, ill be mocking out the entire server setup
i need some interim solution for now though, was hoping for the 'skip test' option :)
@Simon-Kaz if you can perform your test prior to starting Cucumber, you could skip it with a tag
Just tag it with `@flaky` and run with `\u2014tags ~@flaky` if the flaky service is down
yeah, ive added tags and removed those tests from main suite. I really need them ran though :(
the failures are intermittent, so it'd be a shame to have the tests removed just because the service is flaky
Can't you mock out the service?
oh that was already recommended
yeah, ill be doing that. Interim measure required though :D
let it fail so the business prioritizes fixing it? :)
lol its out of my reach sadly
@dkowis I like that advice!
So when people come by and are like, Why are your tests failing? Because I need to insulate myself from crappy services
and then that gets onto the backlog
i guess the \skip test\ is for my sanity
constantly seeing red is annoying :(
and its the only failing test
let that bubble up to your product owner?
if you have one?
yeah, done that
ill send him the last 20 reports i guess
and they don't care about failing tests?
all marked with 1 failure :D
fortunately, given that its only one test, it should be relatively easy to fix?
like to mock I mean
i'm building entire mock server
rather than just that specific service
There is usually a simpler way
are you testing more that you need to mock?
both to speed up the execution, but to also reduce the flakiness
If you're in ruby land, or can use ruby stuff, there's a handy tool called VCR
that you can use to record/playback http requests
Take email. I need to verify that my app sends an email when X happens. I could hook my app up to a fake mail server to do that.
Or I could have a class called EmailSender (that talks SMTP) and another one that\u2019s called FakeEmailSender (that just stores sent messages in memory).
So in my `Then` step I just ask FakeEmailSender if it was told to send any mail. No need to deal with fake servers.
yeah i could simply mock out that service
but its a mobile app, and its all intertwine
its one of a series of calls to external services
so i dont think i can mock that one and leave the rest
Your tests are trying to tell you something. 
They\u2019re whispering \u201cyour app is hard to test. make it easy to test\
nailed it!
Decouple it. Hexagonal architecture FTW
Or ports&adapters if you prefer
Solve the fundamental problem, stop looking for workarounds ;-)
its definitely on the radar
i need the server dev to work out the setup/architecture for mock server though
but yep, will do that
no point working with flaky services
after all, they are not what im testing
Life's too short for that
And yes, you're right. Not what you're testing.
i want to generate cucumber report using gradle.. i used to generate using maven using net.masterthought  so is there any sample code available for gradle as well?
Hi, is it possible to create subscenarios of a scenario, for example say --- I have a scenario having a step and I want to generate many scenarios of it based on a variable used in step --- like if I mention a excel file in a scenarion so based on to total no of row available in the excel file , that no of scenarios would be generated and executed and reported as many test cases that of no of rows ---- any help/lead is much appreciated.
scenario outline
how can I achieve this -- a little details would help 
in my case no of rows is variable ... i depends upon xls file --- xls file could contain 1 row or 1000 row -- if it contains then total one scenario else 1000 scenarios ---
Spring DI + Cucumber + Appium : https://github.com/priyankshah217/AppiumCucumberTest
@aslakhellesoy, i need to two separate feature files. i want to run them one by one, and after run of one feature driver should be killed automatically and initialize new driver for second feature file
i checked prototype and singleton but they did not work
so how can we do that.. let me upload my sample code.
this is my github code: https://github.com/priyankshah217/AppiumCucumberTest.git
is there a way to detect if a feature is finished?
Why do you need to detect if a feature is \finished\?
that'd be the equivalent of @AfterClass for me
Technically yes, but what are you trying to do ?
im using appium to run my tests, and i want @AfterClass to kill the server session
Could you use a step in your feature to ensure the scenario is finished?
or why not use @AfterClass
theres no @AfterClass in cucumber jvm
only @Before and @After
Ah, because it hasn't been finished yet
yep, sadly
this is why i need to know if a feature is finished ;)
seems like the simplest solution for @AfterClass replacement
well, there's the issue open on cucumber-jvm still
http://zsoltfabok.com/blog/2012/09/cucumber-jvm-hooks/
perhaps those \hacks\ can get it done for you
i think i tried all the possible options already ;)
welp, pull requests accepted, heh
zsolt fabok's suggestion is really good if you need to do something at the end of suite
but my suite takes 3 hours, so i need to do something at the end of feature instead :)
Might have to do the much uglier \And the server is stopped\ steps for now
that would get the job done
less than ideal, and it bleeds things that shouldn't be in the feature, but it's where we're at right now
or add a tag to final test case in each feature
and have a tagged @After
ill play around with it some more, i need to work out something anyway :)
good luck
maybe you can get them to allow you to make a pull request?
if it's work related, that is
it is
ill definitely try :)
Has anyone successfully run cucumber-jvm using testng running each user case in a separate thread?
cucumber-jvm is not thread-safe
dont think that'll work
I noticed that...
so for now if I want to use gherkin in java either I run my tests serialized or look for another option other than cucumber-jvm?
Fork your tests is an option
if youre using Jenkins you can use a multi-job plugin as well
Often a symptom of poor test design is that they take a long time, consider that also
thats what im doing
It's not poor test design, is just we've quite a good coverage.
some tests are inherently slow
ui, e2e
and splitting the suite in different groups doesn't look like a good option
so theres no denying that diving those suites would be useful
I was wondering if I could code my own \translator\ or \runner\ and run the steps from there instead of using cucumber-jvm as a core framework
i think i saw something like that
e2e tests can indicate a lack of trust in lower level tests
or a lack of coverage in those lower level tests
There are no lower level tests I'm afraid, legacy code, hard to add unit testing there, also monolythical app so no API tests
It's what they talked about at the CukeUP NYC that I got to go to
yeah, that's hard
But e2e is better than nothing
just slow
sometimes you're not in position to add lower level tests 
my job as an automation engineer is to create e2e/ui tests
Yeah that's a sign of sickness in the organization
developers handle unit/integration tests
They're going to have a bad time
that's a silo
so is mine (among managing a group of testers too)
sorry, man :(
Advocate for the change, not that it may get you anywhere
I'm currently in a similar area right now
and it's unbelievably frustrating
im actively working on changing that
currently mocking out all external services
Hi guys, is there a cucumber-jvm branch accepting the Pickle type Steps from ast?
Gherkin3
hi @demos74dx. As far as I know there isn't yet. Are you interested in helping out with it?
@mattwynne yes, I'm actually digging in the code now to figure out where the matching actually happens and plan to do a PR once I get it working.
I think it needs a pretty big refactor to accomplish though
you could do worse than use http://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby-core for reference
it was a major project to do that for the ruby one
took us about 18 months!
I'll take a look thanks
So, I've been wondering though, or maybe I'm \cuking it wrong\
wouldn't it be better to possibly create a PickleRunner for each Pickle pulled from the feature, then run each pickle as a child
this might make concurrency much better
I'm also just trying to wrap my head around this....
i think making cucumber-jvm threadsafe would make a lot of people happy
So \I think\ the Cucumber runner sets itself up, then scans for StepDefinitions and creates a searchable map of these step definitions, then somewhere gherkin is read and the step is matched to the definition, then presto the method gets run and step accomplished.
Is this the correct flow? Or am I missing something important?
Is I18n replaced in Gherkin3?
probably better to ask that in the Gherkin3 room, just noticed it.
@mattwynne Am I correct in assuming that everything in  core.cucumber.runtime.model is trash and replaced by ast?
also what does ast stand for?
@mattwynne and FeatureBuilder is replaced by Compiler.compile(Feature)?
@demos74dx Cucumber-JVM doesn\u2019t use Gherkin3 yet. AST stands for Abstract Syntax Tree
Hello,\nCan we run Scenarios or feature in parallel with only one runner class ?  
@DaraTran I'm new to cucumber, and have not yet got it to work for myself, but my understanding is that you can parallelize on each Feature.
@DaraTran I have a slightly different use case in that I only have one Feature file and I'd like to parallelize scenarios, so I'm working on a Pull Request to do so.
I'm having problems printing reports on Cucumber JVM 
I'm trying to use  https://github.com/damianszczepanik/cucumber-reporting  the reports are generated but no data is printed on them it shows 0 results
did this happen to anyone?
i get it whenever the build fails
the reports are generated and I have tests that had failed and pass but I get non of this in the reports, the json file is generated and it has the pertinent data, the reports are just not showing it
in your logs, can you see which json files are being used for the report?
i use the jenkins plugin for cucumber jvm reporting
and i had to specify the path to the file, otherwise the reports would return blank because i had other json files in there
I'm using maven by the way, and it is using that file because if I rename it brakes
@trickymuffin are you using maven-surefire-plugin by chance
yes I am!
from what I can see is not injecting the data into the html, but that's strange because I can't even generate the report without the  JSON file with the data that it needs to populate the actual report, I'm so confused 
@demos74dx you\u2019re correct that Gherkin3 will make the .model package obsolete. You\u2019re also right that there are several pieces in Gherkin2 that don\u2019t exist in Gherkin3 (i18n being one of them), so that will have to be reimplemented in either Gherkin3 or Cucumber-JVM - haven\u2019t decided where yet.
It\u2019s a fairly big task to refactor Cucumber-JVM to use Gherkin3 - @brasmusson did it for Cucumber-Ruby. I have a branch on Cucumber-JVM that started the work, but there is still lots to do
@aslakhellesoy I'll take a shot and do a PR, should I deprecate things etc, or define this as a new version?
@aslakhellesoy I think I'm making some good headway.  I also noticed there's a possibility for duplicate featurepaths, I'm adding a unit test for that and a fix.  I'm planning on removing the CucumberFeature stuff and just create a TreeMap with key(featurepath) and value(feature).
have you got a link to your repo demos?
im interested 
@Simon-Kaz I'll get one to you tomorrow, nothing is checked in atm and the code is a cluster fuck (pardon my french)
I'm also referring to the ruby implementation wherever possible to mirror some of that.  Not so great at ruby so it's more of a guideline than anything for me.
@Simon-Kaz I'm also fairly new to Git and contributing to OpenSource, been doing my own thing on Subversion for far far too long.
So I'm still working out the kinks there, like I \think\ I made my own branch on my fork, but it's not showing up on git for w/e reason.  I'll google all that stuff and get it up after I can clear my mental cache from this bit of refactoring I'm working on.
I should also mention, I'm a Selenium Framework Architect(I build automated testing frameworks for companies, Stack: Java, Spring, Selenium) now that I'm trying to integrate with cucumber I'll probably be able to help you guys out with any questions you have for Selenium integration etc...
im an automation specialist (whatever that means haha) for appium and selenium
pretty much an architect as well
appium is pretty much selenium so its refreshing ;)
@aslakhellesoy are cucumber-jvm features, architecture, execution diagrams, etc documented anywhere? Something facing developers, not users.
@Simon-Kaz you should check out my framework when I finally opensource it, supposed to be working on that right now
@Simon-Kaz but I want cucumber-jvm to be a plugin when it launches, so I kinda need this working first.
im planning to open source my framework as well
fully featured appium framework in java
with spring profiles for handling ios/android
right now its all proprietary but im reworking it in my spare time
nice, I've done something similar with spring, but only really done android via selendroid so far.
appium's great
lots of potential
works well with cucumber-jvm too :)
@Simon-Kaz I plan on doing appium too, just no use-case for me to apply myself on it so far.
my current customer needed android only, and it's a webkit app, I tried appium first but it had a hard time with webkit so I tried Selendroid and it worked.
i work for a company thats all mobile
around 10 apps per platform (so 20) to support
appium is an amazing tool for that
reusing 70-80% of framework for each project
even the cucumber feature files 
@Simon-Kaz I assume you're java?
yeah
@Simon-Kaz  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4S6soJAJ7w&feature=player_embedded#t=2409
oh that's nice
gitter embeds
but it didn't capture the time argument
at about 40:00, I have a lightning talk
anthony browness?
@Simon-Kaz yep
im still kicking myself for not going
should've shelled the cash out of my savings
I was a bit off because I couldn't see what I was doing on my own screen, only the projector...flying blind
im still catching up on the talks
@demos74dx hi you asked me 
 are you using maven-surefire-plugin by chance? 
Any notes on that? 
@trickymuffin yes, if you're using maven-surefire-plugin it will mark the entire build as a fail when one fails, and it affects reporting I think too
@trickymuffin you might want to try swapping to maven-failsafe-plugin, all the same functionality...wont do that.
I'll  give it a try thank you so much! 
@aslakhellesoy do you have implementation details for Formatter? Is this now obsolete or in limbo similar to i18n? 
@aslakhellesoy ^ Reporter too
I suspect these are things that belong in cucumber-jvm
not Gherkin3
hummm...what I think from comments in the code:
i18n == ???\nFormatter == obsolete\nReporter == implement in cucumber-jvm\nResult == implement in cucumber-jvm\n
@aslakhellesoy I'll operate on those assumptions until you can get me a solid answer on them.
@demos74dx there are no developer docs apart from the tests. I\u2019ll be releasing some high level architecture docs in the next few weeks - will announce that on the blog
The formatter API will change when we introduce Gherkin3
TBH I wouldn\u2019t recommend you work on adding Gherkin3 to Cucumber-JVM unless you can read my mind. Too much about how to do that and what to improve while doing it is in my head.
@aslakhellesoy I've gotten to the point where I'm using Gherkin3 to read from feature files and return a List of Features to the RuntimeOptions, I feel like that is a good chunk of it.  Do you want me to put it in a branch and send that to you?
@demos74dx thank you for the offer, but I would probably prefer to continue work on my own branch
@demos74dx What would users be able to do if Cucumber was a `@Rule` and not a `@RunWith`?
So their could maintain their own @RunWith configurations, and then simply add the @Rule to the Test Class meant to be run, this is where things get a little weird and (maybe) impossible for cucumber-jvm to do it
Give me like 10 mins, I'll get some examples in a paste and show you what I'm talking about.
@demos74dx is much better at code than technical explanations
@aslakhellesoy understands much better when he sees code
which is why I'm good at reading your mind(I think)
@aslakhellesoy http://junit.org/apidocs/org/junit/rules/TestWatchman.html
http://junit.org/apidocs/org/junit/rules/MethodRule.html
http://junit.org/apidocs/org/junit/Rule.html
I'm still getting pastes together, but read those over if you haven't already
ok
oh sorry, that was the old stuff, there's a new one called TestWatcher
http://junit.org/javadoc/latest/org/junit/rules/TestWatcher.html
https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Rules#testwatchmantestwatcher-rules
Yeah found it
but as you can see, these rules require statement and description to be already implemented at some point
and cucumber-jvm defines those via .feature files
not sure if there's a way to do so within the rule format
So basically, if Cucumber used rules, it would interfer less with other junit extensions?
or coexist more easily?
yes, one could argue that if cucumber used rules you wouldn't need all the plugin infrastructure to allow coexistance
for example with spring, it might not be cucumbers job to define the scope of things.
granted you could still provide ways for people to integrate with spring easier, but now things much more decoupled and therefor easier to maintain
So in `@CucumberRule` we\u2019d just return a `Statement` from `apply` that runs all the features and scenarios, right?
I think that's the correct way to go about it
It might be worth a whack atleast
However, there is a whole hierarchy of features/scenarios/steps to run, and it doesn\u2019t look like a `Statement` can have children...
a Statement is just a runnable
therefore it can have anything you define it to have
Sure, but we\u2019d want to report results for individual scenarios separately
I agree, using Rules instead of RunWith requires a different approach than you're used to taking, but I've found in the end that approach tends to be better anyways
So JUnit wouldn\u2019t know what Cucumber scenario failed - it would only know that *some* scenario failed
you almost have to forget everything you know about modifying the runner and try to work with the (imaginary) runner already in place.
Which again means that IDEs wouldn\u2019t be able to report results nicely
yeah, I'm not 100% sure it's cracked up to work with cucumber-jvm, because it's such a strange usecase for JUnit
I'll do some more research at some point and let  you know what I come up with
That would be excellent. Thanks!
because inevitably I'm going to have to take one of the 3 options I described earlier while integrating my frameworks with cucumber-jvm
I always attempt to create a Rule first, then I work on an integrated runner, and failing that I'd drop cucumber-jvm and look for another solution...or role my own.
In this case, it might be that I trade off IDE results for something that works in my favor in the form of a Rule
or I solve that...who knows :worried: 
Would you prefer I take a shot at making this work as a Rule before I do JS ports?
Up to you
I almost might have to do that first actually, I am getting paid by somebody to produce results, so I kinda need to get a solution out the door(even if temporary) sometime in the next few days.
I\u2019m cleaning up some old stuff on the Java compiler on the `test-case-compiler-take-2` to make it easier for you to work with
Anyways, seems you don't need these pastes, I think you've got the jist of it from the docs.
I'll get back to work, so close to running pickles :)
does anybody know which version my IDE should be at for working on this?
Java version?
Is anybody familiar with the direction the Keyword annotations are going in?  @Given, @When, @Then, etc?
Does someone know how to integrate spoon and cucumber ?
Hi ways, any of you know how to use cucumber in a playframework project (scala)
Solved, thanks anyway
@demos74dx direction?
@aslakhellesoy hey, I got sidelined from cucumber for a few days, back on it now.  I noticed these step def annotations were removed in master and I was wondering how they would get implemented, in the mean-time for my code I just made a @StepDef annotation that replaces all of them.  
@aslakhellesoy core.java.cucumber.runtime.table:  Are these replaced by Gherkin3?  Any need for these Table Diffs, etc...?
@aslakhellesoy  I'm not seeing any advantage to TreeMap over HashMap in RuntimeGlue.  TreeMap would be useful if ordering was necessary but I don't see any need for ordering here.  TreeMap access is O(log n) and HashMap access is O(1), we could see about a 10x increase in speed while accessing StepDefinitions if we switched.
possibly much creater in large Maps, I guess in applications with thousands of Step Definitions.
Yeah maybe. Sounds like bikeshedding to me ;-)
Is there any way to make intellij show colored output? like not monochrome?
I think I got it to work with a plugin called Grep Console
Also Intellij 14 works, as long as you modify run configuration to remove --monochrome
Hi chaps.  Does anyone know if or how Cucumber Java can play nicely with AngularJS?Protractor handles waiting for Angular so looks like a good option for Angular.\n\nWe'd like to keep existing BDD scenarios but interact with model rather than DOM. 
@seandoll if Java can play nicely with it then Cucumber Java can
When Cucumber executes your step definition, control is 100% in your hands
@aslakhellesoy thanks.  I'm wondering if anyone has solved the problem of testing Angular apps from Java. \nBTW, love the Cucumber books
Thanks!
@aslakhellesoy some team members are suggesting using Cucumber-JS.  I think that would mean either having multiple test suites, or losing a fair amount of investment in Java
I always recommend using a Cucumber implementation written in the same language as your app.
That allows you to test the app directly with method calls rather than going via a browser/UI
What\u2019s the server side written in?
Mostly Perl and AngularJS.  It's a browser based app
Would ideally like to test what the users see and do
Sure, but that doesn\u2019t mean all tests must go through the UI. Check out the Test pyramid.
There isn't really an API to test against.  The site is a combination of various technologies which result in a browser based experience
There are unit tests too
I don't expect all tests to be from the front end, but I would expect to be able to do this.  We can do this from DOM, but AngularJS doesn't really work that way.
And while you can test at unit and component level, there's always a chance that they don't work together as expected
The page is made up of a number of interacting web components (for want of a better term)
It's perhaps more of a webdriver issue - just wondered if anyone else has had and solved a similar problem
@seandoll  Do you tried this: https://github.com/AndrewKeig/protractor-cucumber ?
@otoniel-isidoro-sofist - Thanks, yes I saw that.  It is in JavaScript rather than Java, but it might end up being what we need to use.  Trying to avoid either having multiple test suites, or losing a fair amount of investment in Java
Interacting with an app (webapp or other) isn\u2019t a Cucumber concern
It\u2019s your step definitions\u2019 concern.
Your Step Definitions might use a library to reach into your app, but this library should be Cucumber agnostic. Like Selenium.
Yes.  Thanks for your time today @aslakhellesoy.\nIf it's of any interest, the content here looks like it should be of help in my case https://dzone.com/articles/webdriver-and-angularjs
Hi! I have question about docs - is there any public doc(s) which explains cucumber + junit architecture? by architecture i mean step by step - how cucumber parse `*.feature` files, who is running this feature after parsing...? \nI need this docs, because i want to make cucumber run each Scenario(there are few of them in each `*.feature` file) in separate thread. \nIf there are no doc(s) may be someone can give me a glue where should i look at code to achieve such behavior?
not glue but clue :)
@yevgenys sorry you\u2019d have to read the source code I\u2019m afraid
i see, ok thx 
Hi All I need help on this.
Hi All, I need help on how to organise my step definition in cucumber jvm framework.
@folaAkin , i had implemented with Appium , you can refer my project repo on github
https://github.com/priyankshah217/AppiumCucumberTest
I just gave the opportunity to cucumber-jvm again, but for me is really really important that the tests can execute in parallel. Most of the tests are e2e, wether they're loading a webdriver instance or attacking an API. Switching to jbehave, after researching a bit I think I'll find greener fields there.
Can any body help me how to create an executable jar out of cucumber-maven project
i tried with 'maven-shade-plugin' but the created jar does not contain files under 'test' folder. 
Hi all, I've written a blog article about using Cucumber with Serenity if anyone is interested http://balamaci.ro/orchestrating-a-reusable-bdd-web-testing-setup-part-ii/
Hi folks.  Does anyone know where I should put @Before(\@Firefox\) tags?  I can't find very much cohesive information on it.  Intention is to be able to control which webdriver to use for any given test run.\nIt's very possible that this would be better achieved using configuration or Dependency Injection.  Guidance much appreciated :)
For example, The Cucumber Book for Java - which is great btw ;) suggests using\n@Before(\@admin\)\npublic void logInAsAdmin() { ... }\nI'm not sure where should/could the code go, and when is it executed?
you can keep it all in one file
split it into classes, packages
and use dependency injection
i believe its explained in the book
not sure if you've gotten to the dep injection part
Thanks @Simon-Kaz.  Yes, it could be that I didn't realise that Dependency Injection was required.  I'll re-read
hi, i am running into cucumber-spring-1.2.4 vs spring-boot-1.3.0 issues.  http://pastebin.com/KxVyNsRK (java.lang.ArrayStoreException: sun.reflect.annotation.TypeNotPresentExceptionProxy)
i take it cucumber-jvm needs to catch up with the recent spring boot release? or am i running into a more obscure issue here?
narrowed it down, annotating the test defs with @IntegrationTests (org.springframework.boot.test.IntegrationTest) causes the issue. For some reason it cannot be found by the AnnotationParser. So _possibly_ not a cucumber-spring issue. 
Does anyone have tried to use cucumber-jvm from a Gradle project ? 
hey guys,\nI am new in cucumber, but I need to use this(cucumber-jvm + appium) in my project. I installed all this stuff and don't know what to do. I general I understand , but in my project some programmer write some code and there a lot of classes. I confused. Can somebody explain this, or at least send me some helpful articles, I read a lot, but still stuck on this\nThank you very much!
https://github.com/priyankshah217/AppiumCucumberTest
var code = \thank you!\;\n\n\n \n\n\n
```\nthank you!\n\n```\n
@Ekt0s take a look at this: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton/pull/7
As you\u2019ll see from my comment today, gradle swallows cucumber's STDOUT. Any idea how to make it not do that?
(I don\u2019t know gradle)
@aslakhellesoy I still have questions about documentation\nFOR EXAMPLE, I have next code:\n```\n
@aslakhellesoy  I still have questions about documentation\nFOR EXAMPLE, I have next code:\n```\n    @Given(\^I am at the login screen$\)\n    public void atLoginScreen() {\n        assertTrue(\We are not at the login screen\\n                AppiumUtils.elementIsPresent(DriveWernerAndroidCucumberUtils.props.getProperty(\androidNameBox\), driver)\n                && AppiumUtils.elementIsPresent(DriveWernerAndroidCucumberUtils.props.getProperty(\androidPswdBox\), driver));\n    }\n```\n\nWhere I can find documentation about this keyword, like  **assertTrue,  sendKeys**\nThank you very much for  you reply)
that's appium, not cucumber
the only cucumber thing in that sample is   @Given(\^I am at the login screen$\)
assertTrue is a junit thing
@Simon-Kaz can you explain in two words about appium, cucumber and junit. In general I understand but still suck
Cucumber runs scenarios and your step definitions and reports results.
Your step definitions use Appium to talk to your app.
JUnit assertsions cause step definitions and scenarios to fail if assertions are not met
@mikolasw clearer?
i had done some work using appium+cucumber+spring -- you can refer my repo: https://github.com/priyankshah217/AppiumCucumberTest
@aslakhellesoy thank you, man! very much. I understood
have next problem, can someone help me?\n``` \nMessage: org.openqa.selenium.remote.UnreachableBrowserException: Could not start a new session. Possible causes are invalid address of the remote server or browser start-up failure.\n.\n.\n.\nCaused by: org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException: Connect to 127.0.0.1:4723 [/127.0.0.1] failed: Connection refused\n``` 
@mikolasw not Cucumber related, sorry
@aslakhellesoy thank you! I solve this problem
@aslakhellesoy also I have some problem, that I cannot open .feature file in my Android Studio
because when I click on the .feature file in Android Studio its opening a Notes App, and I cannot edit this
I did it, thank you!
hey guys,\n\nhow to add image comparison in cucumber?
Hi, guys. Could someone help me please to figure  what's wrong with build of my pull-request https://travis-ci.org/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/jobs/95061885\n```\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project cucumber-core: Could not resolve dependencies for project info.cukes:cucumber-core:jar:1.2.5-SNAPSHOT: Failed to collect dependencies at info.cukes:cucumber-html:jar:0.2.4-SNAPSHOT: Failed to read artifact descriptor for info.cukes:cucumber-html:jar:0.2.4-SNAPSHOT: Could not transfer artifact info.cukes:cucumber-html:pom:0.2.4-SNAPSHOT from/to codehaus-snapshots (https://nexus.codehaus.org/snapshots/): nexus.codehaus.org: Unknown host nexus.codehaus.org -> [Help 1]\n```\n\n
Why it can't deal with already existing snapshot ?\n
sorry, I found the root cause.\nIs there any information when it could be fixed ?
@mikolasw use an inage comparison library if you can find one
@mikolasw , you can use imagemagick/sikuli or applitools (Paid) for image comparision
thank you guys, but i already solved this
and I have next question about sendKeys(). does this method have some limitation?
solved
anyone had ever written custom cucumber test runner?
i have a pre-condition, on that basis runner should pick feature file
or anyone can suggest alternate approach to do so
hi, I'm new to cucumber. I need to figure out what new features/enhancements introduced in the past releases. How can I find it? I'm looking for something similar to release notes. Thanks a lot in advance..
@asamaraw https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/master/History.md
Are there any tools or plugins which only allow gherkin users to use defined step definitions?
To enforce that new step definitions are not written?
*To enforce that undefined step definitions have not been written in the gherkin files?
@trungie running cucumber with \u2014strict will call cucumber to fail if there are undefined steps. See \u2014help for more.
@aslakhellesoy interesting, will this work with cucumber-jvm?
my language of choice is java
looks like i can! https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm#cli-runner
Are you using Maven and/or JUnit to run Cucumber?
gradle junit
If so you can also specify `@CucumberOptions(strict=true)`
On your JUnit class
Or you can pass it via a system property: `-Dcucumber.options=\u201c\u2014strict\u201d` - same thing
i thin I'll setup strict mode with intellij\u2019s auto test runner
think*
Hi, there is a way in java that I can have a watcher that will detect changes on files and will automatically run cucumber again?
@edmilsonefs the java nio file watcher is probably what you want - make a main() that keeps an eye on a directory or file or whatever and invokes cucumber or junit 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16251273/can-i-watch-for-single-file-change-with-watchservice-not-the-whole-directory might be an intro for a single file, otherwise check the javadocs for how to watch a whole folder
Hi folks - we\u2019re preparing a report on BDD & Cucumber usage in the wild. We\u2019d love to hear how you use them! https://cucumber.typeform.com/to/kjrSc2?audience=gitter
Hi Guys, Need some help. How to run features in specific Order? I am new to cucumber so not much idea
@pandey012 short answer: you shouldn't, you can find plenty of long answers in the cukes google group (two examples: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/cukes/order/cukes/tGos-LhALOo/7MNkbxyaOJ8J https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/cukes/order/cukes/LBeOz3qz3dg/G5ltAJ7HEgAJ)
it is usually a symptom that you are using cucumber simply as a test automation tool. have a read here: https://rlogiacco.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/cucumber-is-not-a-testing-framework/
@pandey012  from my point of view, cucumber is used to model/test behavior of your application, I believe if you need to run certain feature files in certain order, then i think you should consider reorganize your feature files and slice them in a better way
Hey guys, I am not sure if this is the right place for this but: is there a way to dynamically skip the execution of a scenario? We are currently experimenting with a Before hook but have no clue how to tell the Cucumber Runtime to skip the current scenario. Any ideas? Our setup is: Cucumber-JVM (1.2.2) with Groovy (2.4.4) and Geb (0.13.1). Thanks in advance! Some background info: in our application we are able to enable/disable features during runtime and we need some tests to run when a feature is enabled and other tests when a feature is disabled. Any suggestion how to do this?
@sjacobs try with tags. you can tag scenarios and exclude/include them when you run cucumber
@paoloambrosio thanks for the hint. That's also something we had in mind and now it sounds like it's the only way. We will give it a try.
Anyone else using groovy step definitions?  Looks like there's a bug with taking a List<String> as a parameter - fails with an NPE related to the delimiter being null
has anyone worked with creating a runnable fatJar or  uberJar of cucumber /  tests , so that its executable like java -jar mytests.jar ?
@davestimpert yes, that looks like a bug because ParameterInfo is initialized with delimiter null. Unfortunately the groovy implemention ignores annotation as well, so there is no 'pretty' way to workaround it. You could do the following if you insist to use typed parameters in your step definition:\n\n```\n@XStreamConverter(StringListConverter)\nclass StringList {\n    List words;\n}\n\nclass StringListConverter extends Transformer<StringList> {\n    def StringList transform(String string) {\n        String[] tokens = string.tokenize(\\\\\s?\)\n        return new StringList(words: Arrays.asList(tokens))\n    }\n}\n\nGiven(~/test (.+)/) {StringList list ->\n    list.words.forEach({\n        System.out.println(it)\n    })\n}\n```\n\nOn the other hand, it might be more convenient to just split/tokenize the parameter. Sorry for the long post...
@davestimpert  I created a pull request which should fix the NPE. Might be interesting for you: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/pull/980
awesome!  Thanks @sjacobs , you saved me from doing that pull request.
Is somebody using Allure for test reports?
If yes. I hope this information will be useful for you. We released  cucumber-allure-plugin. Fix some blocker problems which we found in current Cucumber-JVM adaptor.

Hello Everyone,I need help with some information.In my last project I used Cucumber with java..my project set up used  Selenium Webdriver with Page Object/Page Factory but I had issue with null pointer error when my test grew bigger with multiple step definitions.So my question is one 1: Has any used the shared driver concept explained by Aslak?,I saw it sometimes ago but can't seem to locate it. 2.Can someone  explain the best practices in terms of  naming and arrangement of step definitions? 3 Also, how can I use just one runner class for all the packages that I have? Please it will be appreciated if I can get an example for all these points i.e a project using  Selenium Webdriver with Page Object and has multiple step definitions.
recently updated selenium server to 2.48.2 
i am getting error while opening firefox browser using selenium with cucumber
for chrome and IE it is running fine
what is error?
Did you update firefox version?
cucumber.runtime.CucumberException: Failed to instantiate class 
What about version of FF
i am using  below mentioned dependencies
<dependency>\n\t\t\t<groupId>info.cukes</groupId>\n\t\t\t<artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>\n\t\t\t<version>1.2.2</version>\n\t\t\t<scope>test</scope>\n\t\t</dependency>\t\t\n\t\t<dependency>\n\t\t\t<groupId>info.cukes</groupId>\n\t\t\t<artifactId>cucumber-junit</artifactId>\n\t\t\t<version>1.2.2</version>\n\t\t\t<scope>test</scope>\n\t\t</dependency>\n\t\t<dependency>\n\t\t\t<groupId>junit</groupId>\n\t\t\t<artifactId>junit</artifactId>\n\t\t\t<version>4.12</version>\n\t\t\t<scope>test</scope>\n\t\t</dependency>\n\t\t<dependency>\n\t\t    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>\n\t\t    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>\n\t\t    <version>2.48.2</version>\n\t\t</dependency>
firefox version is 41
any idea??
is it previos version of selenium work with firefox 41
?
Problem may be in browser version
let me try updating to latest one and check
no no
don`t update browser
update version of selenium
as i can see, Last version of selenium is 2.53
yes i know
latest one will work with latest FF version
right 
i need to update both
no
so u suggesting only selenium part?
yes
latest version of selenium work with previos version of selenium
It is popular problem(((
I don`t know why
I hope it should help
i updated browser to 43 
and updated to selenium to 53
it is working now
thing was i was using  Selenium 48 version and FF 43 version
and it was working fine for me
but then my browser got autoupdated
to 45 version
and then it started giving error
so i downgraded the FF version to 41 
but it didnt work out
))))\n\nIts happen very often\n\n\n
so i was confused 
whether to upgrade or downgrade FF or Selenium one
you never know which combination works out ;)
I understand you\n
thanks for your help
I have been seeing it in 4 years\n
I wonder if you can help with a question. If I have steps which create some state, can I re-use that state in later steps in the same scenario
so 'given i create a car', creates say a mini
can i then say something like, Then 'the type of car should be <whatever type the given created>'
@andyg101 yes. You can use Java to remember all necessary information.
You can use class property or create class container for transfer data berween steps.
For example in python some Bdd framework use containers for transfer data between steps. I created the same approach in Java
@kirlionik  thanks for the response. I am already doing this using the 'holder' pattern which i read about in the cucumber book. Perhaps I haven't explained my example properly. I was wondering if it is possible to refer to some state that has been produced in a previous step in the gherkin script itself
e.g. given I create a foo -> step def creates a foo with an id
Why?
then the id of foo should be foo.id
I think it is a good idea that all steps independ
really?
Yes
that is what I was woondering
i thought that might be the answer
It is flexibility 
it is because I want to assert the contents of some xml, some of which will be a value created in a previous step
For all things we have Java )))
I am trying to make t he step def code generic so i can re-use it
As For me, I am using Cucumber+Spring Java+Maven+Allure Report
@andyg101 Your approach has pluses and minuses. I think all depends on project
sure. I am just playing with a proof of concept at the moment. Trying to work out the best way to use Cucumber
I have been doing it in last year )))

how to write step definitions in the scala-calculator example
@paoloambrosio You can refer to this link: http://func.io/post/36452127031/pure-scala-bdd-made-easy-with-sbt-and-cucumber it's pretty much the same, but if you want to glue your state (ex. having a processing pipeline in the background steps and want to use something in different stepDefs) then you will need to add extra lines to your stepdef classes
Also if you are loading data from tables then you will use the normal datatables since it's already part of the cucumber.api package
@khaledhafez  unfortunately this plugin only works with sbt 13.0 and doesn't appear to be being maintained any more :(
(the templemore plugin used in this tutorial)_
Hi all, i'm experiencing a lot of slow lookup times with .findElements - i'm pulling a table then doing lots of finds on things within that table. Is there a way to \cache the whole table object\ so lookups within it are fast?
@henricook doesn\u2019t sound related to cucumber. Have you tried to ask the selenium forum? (Assuming that\u2019s what you\u2019re using)
bit new to this
Cucumber doesn\u2019t know anything about HTML, HTTP or the web in general
I want to start server before starting automation, i want to use Spring @Service, is it possible to initialize application context in RunCuke class?
I am driving .  Answer later
I am using cucumber + spring
@priyankshah217 you could do that in @Before hooks
but before hooks execute before scenario.. if i put in @before hooks then it may execute before each scenario
i want to start server only once before execution
Do you use junit?
yes..
So it means that you have two type @before hooks
first: cucumber
second: junit
Junit hooks execute before all scenarios which define in RunCuke
oh.. shall i use Junit before class ?
with cucumber?
yes
you can put it in Runner class
I do it if i need in some actions before all tests
so that means we can initialize @service within runner class?
Do you want create context for  all your tests?
yes.. 
so I think you can use another way
Without Hooks
so whats alternative approach?
In all step definition classes you define annotation such as:
@ContextConfiguration(classes = {AppConfig.class})\n@DirtiesContext(classMode = DirtiesContext.ClassMode.AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD)\npublic class BasetepDef { ......
Do not remember about annotation @DirtiesContext
Is it help you?
yes.. 
thanks for ur time and effort
Hi,Can someone confirm me whether cucumber can be integrated with Seetest
@priyankshah217 @kirlionik The `@ContextConfiguration` annotation does not need to but put on every step definition class, but if it is put on more than one the all have to have exactly the same annotations, see the bullet list in the description of issue [711](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/pull/711#issue-32713233)
Hello all! I am having a problem \Result was missing for this step\! Does anyone can helps me?
Hi guys!\nI would test that my android application send message (via IPC) to a third party application.\nI would execute the test without this external app.\nHave you some suggestions on how to do this?
@glureau When it comes to testing your app with integration of other applications/services then you need to do one of two things:\n1. Integration your cucumber scenarios with Espresso to make sure that the other apps are behaving properly with yours.\n2. Mocking the other apps based on their app category (not very good approach however can be used if those apps are not installed on the target device).
Thanks @khaledhafez , I will have a look to Espresso ;)
Just for the record, I have read the Espresso documentation but it doesn't allow the multiple apps... but UIAutomator does (still developed by Google, so I think it was your proposal actually Khaled). Because it's not easy to automate the app installation in our project, we've choosen to have both tests, one test with mock so we ensure both apps should behave properly, and one test with UIAutomator where we check the final behaviour and have some setup to do manually before to run it.
@glureau --have a look to Appium? i think you can hookup appium+cucumber
Not tried yet but it could help yes, thanks for the idea @priyankshah217 \nUIAutomator looks great, but I cannot run automation tests on devices when API < 18, even for the tests that doesn't need UIAutomator. In fact Cucumber runner try to load the class that is not present on the API, and the only solutions I see right now is to manipulate bytecode, use reflection to proxify the v18 classes, or simply drop tests on older devices... any of this doesn't look right :/\nIf you have any idea on how to fix that, it could be awesome for me.
@glureau , sorry to say but i do not have much idea about UIAutomator, but i can help u for appium+cucumber you can refer my repo : https://github.com/priyankshah217/AppiumCucumberTest
Uiautomator has limitation, you will have to accept it :( , espresso is good but it has different way of writing UITest cases
My first concern is that Espresso doesn't manage multiple apps, you can only check and play inside your app.\nLooks like appium could handle that, will have a look later, and again, thanks for the link @priyankshah217 !
Does anyone have liks for tutorial about cucumber+testng+webdriver
is there any way to extends stepdefinations ? i have few definations which are common across multiple feature file
so my thought was include common step defination to one abstractStepDef class and all other stepdefination class extent abstract class
I already taken care of autowiring with spring 
@badrinrs -- Google it you would get multiple links with this combinations
Would this be a good starting point: https://automatictester.co.uk/2015/06/11/basic-cucumberjvm-selenium-webdriver-test-automation-framework/
@priyankshah217 I think you don't need to have this steps in each Steps file. Let them in the current file and Cucumber will do the job properly for you (it works a bit like that on my current android project).
Hi, Is their a way to run specific scenarios only in single feature file.
Suppose I have a humanbeing.feature  and I have  scenarios like see,laugh,cry,smile, etc...
U can use tags
and If I feel to run just laugh and cry..in that feature file, how can I do it
yes tags can be done but what if I have multiple tags... @human @animal 
and at particular time I want to run both....
we use cucumber with java
U can use multiple tags
Is their any other way other than tagging the scenarios....
because I may end up with multiple tagging for each and every scenario...
@lavicasula_twitter You can either use file:line[:line] or specify the name of the scenario to be executed, see https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm#configuration
thanks for the information bjorn
Is their any option in cucumber like \if-else\ case like to execute the  steps
like if step 2 failed execute steps 5 and 6.else execute 3 and 4 like
@lavicasula_twitter the point that cucumber is mainly used for specification, so when you want to simulate conditional failures (if-else) then you can write scenarios specifying those failures and actually make sure that you are covering those behaviours in your application.
Agree with Khaled, you probably should have 2 scenarios here (the first one with steps 3 and 4, the second with your current steps 5 and 6)
hi all, i'm wondering how I might deal with this situation: I have a \Background: Given I am signed in\ which means the system is trying to login before each scenario. The problem is cookies seem to persist between Scenarios (chrome driver) - so it's already logged in, which is confusing things. Can i clear cookies between scenarios? Should they be clearing already?
You probably should. Don't know what tools you're using but I don't think cucumber is cleaning them for you anyway :/
I was poking around that java8 problem, but I don't seem to be able to duplicate it
I grabbed the latest java 8, u92, and wasn't able to get any problems on osx with it
mvn test on master works *just fine*
OH, its openjdk that is the problem
@dkowis The java8 problem is much about fragility, yes maybe Oracle java8 u92 works fine, but Oracle java8 u60 has been reported not to work (#949), so with Oracle java8 u93, when it comes, we might get the problem back.
Yeah, I'm just digging into it
trying to reproduce it
I set up a virtualbox with openjdk8 so that I can see it happen
maybe I'll get a pile of JDKs installed and script some sort of \does this work\ setup
so I can run the code base through a pile of JDKs
there's jenv, but it's super not quite as good as rbenv, heh
Now my ubuntus is freaking out over UTF-8 filenames, even though all my  locale stuff is UTF-8
so I've got to figure it out
it might be a problem doing the stuff in the vbox shared folder....
I'll grab 8u60, and 8u92, and openjdk, and then see if I can make sure mvn test works on all of them. Think that's good enough @brasmusson ?
Woot, I was able to set up jenv pretty quickly to handle multiple JDKs, so hopefully this will be easy to test
I saw that @aslakhellesoy has a java8-fixes branch, and I'll take a look at that
Actually, I don't know why that isn't merged yet, it works, it's got tests. I don't know the context of what \cleanup\ is desired. I'll try to remember to check gitter if/when responses happen
because timezones
@henricook I totally agree with @glureau , you should clear the cookies while testing
You can have it in the background or in the @BeforeScenario. Also you can use something like Selenimum that can integrate with cucumber and using it you can easily clear the cookies in your automated test 
Hard coded page name:\nWhen user fills details on add to cart page\nAnd user submits form\nThen user should be redirected to confirmation page\n\n\nParameterzied page name:\nWhen user fills details on \add to cart page\\nAnd user submits form\nThen user should be redirected to \confirmation page\\n 
what could be ideal way to do so
??
@priyankshah217 I'd encourage you to go through this link , I am sure you will find an example that matches your case https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Tutorials-and-Related-Blog-Posts
@khaledhafez , thanks for sharing.. it has mentioned reuse stepdefinations to achieve good code maintainablity

if you like, kindly star it!!!! :) also please suggest your views so i can improve it
Does anyone have an example of a global hook equivalent to SetupClass and TeardownClass?
From what I can google i'll have to have a class variable to check if the setup has already executed already
@bobolified if you are using a DI framework like Spring you can do the same thing (lazy bean with shutdown method), otherwise you'll have to code it yourself as you found on Google or on the Cucumber examples
@jparekh59_twitter to setup a Scala project you should have the feature files in src/test/resources directory
then in src/test/scala you need at least two files. in the example they are RunCukesTest.scala and RpnCalculatorStepDefinitions.scala
the first one is a junit test that runs cucumber in the test phase of your fevourite build tool (e.g. sbt, gradle, maven, ...)
the second one contains the step defintions. if you are familiar with any other cucumber implementation and with scala, it should be easy to understand how that works by looking at the example (https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/examples/scala-calculator)
@paoloambrosio are you suggesting to mix cucumber with Spring? I'm familiar with junit and my cucumber tests are already running with junit runner but I'm not sure if I should write junit tests mixed with cucumber tests
@paoloambrosio , i had tried to mix cucumber+spring
u can refer my repo : https://github.com/priyankshah217/AppiumCucumberTest
@bobolified Yes, Cucumber is compatible with Spring DI (https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/java-di). When including the Spring support library your step definitions will be created as Beans and all annotated fields will be injected by Spring. I have an OLD example that uses Cucumber+Spring to test a Web application (https://bitbucket.org/paoloambrosio/web-java/src) and the WebDriver instance is a spring bean with lazy init and destroy method (not sure if the syntax has changed since then). Otherwise there is an example in Cucumber itself (https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/examples/spring-txn)... or probably there are a few blog posts you can Google.
I'm running into this error when I try to add tag for my feature.
Exception in thread \main\ gherkin.TagExpression$BadTagException: Bad tag: \scenarioLogin\\n\tat gherkin.TagExpression$TagExp.<init>(TagExpression.java:122)\n\tat gherkin.TagExpression.add(TagExpression.java:57)\n\tat gherkin.TagExpression.<init>(TagExpression.java:17)\n\tat cucumber.runtime.java.JavaHookDefinition.<init>(JavaHookDefinition.java:28)\n\tat cucumber.runtime.java.JavaBackend.addHook(JavaBackend.java:173)\n\tat cucumber.runtime.java.MethodScanner.scan(MethodScanner.java:66)\n\tat cucumber.runtime.java.MethodScanner.scan(MethodScanner.java:41)\n\tat cucumber.runtime.java.JavaBackend.loadGlue(JavaBackend.java:86)\n\tat cucumber.runtime.Runtime.<init>(Runtime.java:91)\n\tat cucumber.runtime.Runtime.<init>(Runtime.java:69)\n\tat cucumber.runtime.Runtime.<init>(Runtime.java:65)\n\tat cucumber.api.cli.Main.run(Main.java:35)\n\tat cucumber.api.cli.Main.main(Main.java:18)
this is how i declared my feature
@@featureLogin\nFeature: Logging on
just \@featurelogin\
here is the code throwing the exception
public TagExp(String tagName) {\n            if(!tagName.startsWith(\@\)) {\n                throw TagExpression.this.new BadTagException(tagName);\n            } else {\n                this.tagName = tagName;\n            }\n        }
sorry nevermind the missing @ was from my @Before annotation
Is there a way to guarantee the order of @Before? I tried to add tag to the feature and then tag to the scenario but running it multiple times sometimes the @Before scenario is being called first instead of the @Before code for the feature.
You can specify an \order\ parameter for the @Before annotation if you have to. I never liked it though ;-) Sure the two hooks are dependent? There is no before hook for a feature but instead scenarios inherit the tags of the feature they belong to.
@paoloambrosio  thanks i figured out the order within @Before
I'm now trying to figure out how to get the @After hook to only run once when all the scenarios are done
I have been googling and there are mentions of @AfterAll hook but i dont see it in the documentation
You should be able to do that with Spring DI. Don't know what you are trying to execute at the end of the test, but usually that is the perfect scenario for the destroy method of a Spring Bean.
@paoloambrosio  thanks but I dont want to include Spring DI. Is there anyway I can get the list of scenarios at run time?

@bobolified apparently my reply was lost. What are you trying to achieve?
Hi All, I am developing scripts using cucumber and selenium. what is the best way to pass the test data (Excel,Data table,examples) , can anyone help me on this  please
I hope this is related to cucumber-jvm. I keep getting \org.sonar.java.jacoco.JacocoController$JacocoControllerError: Looks like several tests executed in parallel in the same JVM, thus coverage per test can't be recorded correctly.\ error while running tests with cucumber / jacoco / surefire. As soon as I remove all .feature files tests run as expected. Any hints how to solve this issue? 
Are you running the unit test at the same time? What's your configuration exactly?
@lathamparala_twitter  I would recommend you to use Examples and to keep then short and understandable. If you want more guidance, an example could be great.
@glureau first unit tests are run, then integration tests (during verify phase) 
But I've found out that it relates to jacoco junit listener 
So for now I just removed jacoco junit listener and everything works fine. But a real solution would be appreciated. 
Hey all
actually im using cucumber 
#NAME?
but when i try put @BeforeClass is shown error (my goal is open just one FF instance per class, and not per method)
why one per class? can't you just open only one instance?
SomeOne can explain me how does work cucumber? 
How can I take screenshot for test failed in cucumber??
Hi all! I've got a massive delay between scenarios (~10 seconds) - i don't have any @befores or @afters - can anyone think of anything else that could be sucking up that time? I'm on a very fast machine
@ajit-jadhav I define something like this in a base class, http://pastebin.com/ZXndE3QY
on examination it looks like my step defs are getting instantiated a lot, all over the place, and taking some time to become so
looks highly inefficient
Anyone else not seeing cucumber-jvm.jar, in the central repositories? It's like they're all gone this morning.
@henricook  Actually reinstantiating step defs is the only way (yet) to ensure that your tests run in isolation across scenarios. Why would instantiation of your step defs take so much time? Edit: The pastebin link seem to be dead already.
How to capture failure screenshot in cucumber?
please help.

Does anyone know if it's possible to embed a video into a cucumber report?
Hello Everyone, I have 2 questions which i am trying to search an answer for but not able to get one. Question-1: How does one specify the cucumber tag options in the pom.xml file. Question-2: Is there a way to pass the tag values dynamically in cucumber options as it currently resides outside the Java class file
under <properties> <cucumber.version>x.y.z</cucumber.version> </properties>
you can specify all cucumber related versions under properties section
and even in <dependency>\n            <groupId>info.cukes</groupId>\n            <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>\n            <version>1.1.8</version>\n        </dependency>
@viveksanganna1804  you need to call the runner 
u don't need to specify it in pom.xml in that just call the runner class 
& in runner class call all ur tags 
hey there can some one let me know do i need nay additional config to do for it complains about the undefined steps
has anyone used the cucumber parallel plugin 
Hi All,                                                                                                                                          has anyone one encountered the below problem before?I am using the shared driver implementation from  https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/master/examples/java-webbit-websockets-selenium/src/test/java/cucumber/examples/java/websockets/SharedDriver.java                                                                                                                                   However, Aslak Helles\u00f8y has used firefox in its implementation. The problem is when I run the test with firefox,all the scenarios run  fine irrespective of the number of scenarios in a feature file, however if I change the browser to chrome,it can only run one scenario in the feature file. Once the first scenario finish executing, chrome hangs and does not reuse the open browser instance unlike firefox which reuses the open browser instance by executing  the next scenario.
@Lplay  Hi  @Lplay , have you changed the driver to chrome in the code as well ? For Chrome you should use its own WebDriver implementation: https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/chrome/ChromeDriver.html or use a headlesss one http://seleniumhq.github.io/htmlunit-driver/org/openqa/selenium/htmlunit/HtmlUnitDriver.html to be more free. In the this case, your browser wil not be hitted at all.
How can I execute All features from single runner file ??
@ajit-jadhav either just mvn clean test or right click on your runner class and choose run as JUnit test
That is not an issue... I mean , want to execute multiple feature files from single Runner class.
@ajit-jadhav  if you want execute not all but multiple features, you can filter them by using tags
@ajit-jadhav  you are welcome, you can find more examples in cucumber-jvm [examples](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/examples) repo.
Hi , Can anybody let me know the process and configuration to run extent reports in cucumber-junit?
I am not having any maven dependency.

if my program uses cucumber cli runner to run my feature files on cucumber jvm 
how can i convert my program to start using the runcukestest class (JUnit runner)
i need to do some modifications in this plugin https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cucumber+Reports+Plugin (or maybe use another if possible)
@emilianoGbt it's an open source project NOT maintained by the Cucumber community: https://github.com/jenkinsci/cucumber-reports-plugin
@bennycwlau your JUnit class will be picked up when you run JUnit tests as long as it's in the classpath (e.g. src/test/java in Maven, Gradle or SBT)
Hi All,\nI want to load CSV file  in feature file as I have thousand's of scenario to test.\nIs any sample project or any way to do that ./
Kindly guide me.\nThanks
You can use scenario outline, put all data to example tables
but do not treat cucumber as testNG
both are totally different
If have approximate 50000 scenario to test 
means I can not do using BDD ?
well, i cant do such testing.. :) this is breaching of test pyramid
Means I have to find some other way :worried: 
but i do not understand, what is the purpose of adding 50000 scenario in acceptance tests?
dont u have unit and integrations tests are in place?
why all burden on acceptance test only?
i would recommend, design your tests smartly
I am using Integration test only, I thought if I will do by BDD so it will be easy for designer's 
@pankajrajput1462 A big part of BDD is to get agreement with the business, users etc on the correct behaviour, do you think anyone from the business will go through 50000 scenarios and say \yes, this is what we want\? If not, you do not need 50000 scenarios in your feature files. You need only a small subset in your feature files (as may as the business is interesting to go trough thoroughly and say \yes, this is what we want\), and use some testing tool for the other things needed to be tested.
on big projects with big company, someone in your customer project team is usually paid to review the specifications you wrote.
Because if nobody from the customer review these scenarios, I can write whatever I want inside, and make the app fit what I wrote, and the customer will have paid for something different of what he asked.
Hey, are there any Clojurists here that can advise a good way of dealing with DataTables? asMaps returns UnmodifiableRandomAccessLists of UnmodifiableMaps that I've found hard to work with using generic clojure sequence processing?
Hi Guys....Need some help on building  structure where my java code is being called from groovy step definitions..any pointers on sample projects?
Cucumber feature --> Java step Definitions -->Groovy files(This will parse json easily) --->
@vsivas can't you use Groovy step defiintions? An example: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/master/examples/groovy-calculator/src/test/groovy/calc/CalculatorSteps.groovy
Hi to all! How I can access steps from scenario to log it?
@91bess_twitter  yu can't just because a Scenario is just a text file (live doc if you want) and steps are its implementation. But you can access Scenario object in your steps:  ```public void someStepMethod(Scenario scenario) {System.out.println(\*********** Just finished running scenario: \+ scenario.getStatus());```
@Javix Thanks, but I want to put all steps into the report (manual qa could use it to reproduce bug). Something like this http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cucumber/images/cucumber_report.jpg
Hey, my Cucumber for Java IntelliJ plugin keeps adding cucumber.api.spring in the glue setting for new feature runs. Whilst we use Spring DI within the glue, we don't need this addition, and it causes execution failure with ```Exception in thread \main\ java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/springframework/transaction/TransactionDefinition```. Have any others seen this issue?
I apply this workaround, but when debugging tests, this is pretty frustrating? https://foreach.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=9404422
Have others seen this issue before? 
@91bess_twitter you can use different Maven plugins to generate HTML, JSON or other reports,  see examples [here](https://damienfremont.com/2016/05/09/how-to-cucumber-test-report-plugin-2-with-maven-and-java/)
@Javix Thanks, I used extentreports plugin for cucumber, but when I tried to implement adding screenshot to failed scenarios - steps aren't displayed in the report
@91bess_twitter You don't need to use extentreports, just use Maven surefire plugin as explained in the posted site and it will work just fine. You can also take a look at [cucumber-jvm examples](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/master/examples/java-webbit-websockets-selenium/src/test/java/cucumber/examples/java/websockets/RunCukesTest.java)
hi everyone, I've found a bug in cucumberJVM 1.2.4 that looks like its been fixed. However I can't find any later versions?! Is the project still under active development?
@w4tson 1.2.4 is actually the latest version released in July 2105. The github repository is always in the [same place](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/commits/master) and the last commit dates the 26th of May, 2016. If you find a bug, just open an issue.
How can I call step definition inside step definition in JAVA.
PLease help
No, you can't... But want to know what's the use case??
1. There are two different feature files
2. Common step definitions are called multiple time in both.
3. So thinking to group them all together and call in single step definition.
@w4tson  The latest build from the master branch is available as snapshot-releases (currently 1.2.5-SNAPSHOT), see the snapshot release section here: https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm#installation. Yes, the project is still under active development. However, lately most effort has been put into the new Gherkin releases (Gherkin v3 and Gherkin v4). Cucumber-Ruby, Cucumber-JS and Specflow have already been updated to use the new Gherkin releases. Cucumber-JVM is coming next.
Hi all, wondering how people use cucumber with Scala ? Any tips, libraries, etc. Cheers
Hi guys, \n\nI have a question, I am modeling one transaction using SOAP WS. so I have to call one WS and get value of this response. Then in other step,  I have to create another request to call other web service using the previous value. \n\nDo you know if exists any library for this? or if it is a good practice set the response by the first step and use it on the second step? \n\nThanks.

I want to read parameter values from Testng.xml file and then use the same in cucumber stepdefs. Is there any way by which I can do that ?
@sayom88 asking for updates when your question is the last in the channel won't change anything. please remember that most people here are not paid and are unlikely to answer your questions as quick as you wish (guess what! most people have a job and answer here in their personal time!).

Hi. I'm trying to run the github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/examples/java-webbit-websockets-selenium on my Mac (10.11.6) doing `mvn install`, but I get the error `Could not initialize class cucumber.examples.java.websockets.SharedDriver`. A Firefox window comes up, but closes after some time (55.393 s). The last thing I tried was installing the new geckodriver v0.9.0 from github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases, but I get the same error. (I'm not sure where to put the DesiredCapabilities for this geckodriver.) My Java version is 1.8.0_66. If there is no easy fix for this example, then I would be glad to be directed to some other simple Cucumber-JVM-web example (Scala-Play-sbt if possible).
Hi. Having difficulty understanding how to setup cucumber-jvm on android-studio with no source for the app

Anyone who have tried to create a dynamic feeder of features (test-scenarioes) for a Cucumber runner? I would like to have cucumber instances running continously and accept streams of data, data that now is currently being written into .features file.
An example of why could be: Where you would like to create an integration with a slack bot, this slack bot records scenarioes and steps and then calls up a cucumber runner and tells it to run the recorded data.
Hi, anyone who is familiar with Cucumber Scala for runner ? Having some trouble ...
Hi, what is your question about Cucumber-Scala? 
Hi, I am working with Serenity BDD with Jbehave and Junit.I have created a maven archetype project for Jbehave.It is also running as part of maven build.But when I tried to create a new stroy, step definition , steps and page objects.Then I want to run the testrunner class as Junit..it is giving me error.Also From Maven Build Only default project is running, not the custom project.Can anyone please let me know how to execute a specific Test Suite from  Serenity Jbehave and from maven build also? Regards,Avijit
Hi everyone (and Alexander), I am using Cucumber + Scala + SBT. With command 'sbt cucumber', Cucumber tests are executed... but I don't have report in folder target. This without Class TestRunner. I added a TestRunner scala class, to get  my report (json, xml or html), but it looks like totally unuseful. Do you have any idea ? Thanks for everything.
@laurieMH  Can you please, share your code on the gist? 
@laurieMH  Please check if you have a \com.novocode\ % \junit-interface\ % \0.11\ % \test\ as dependency. Also please check, if you correctly set report plugin and output directory. Here is my sample: https://gist.github.com/alexromanov/2a85a3eec05b25f3b6b192db6d2e0222
Are there any example web projects using Cucumber + Scala + SBT that I could have a look at?
@jkleiser I have not found any repos or even blogs about web automation with scala and cucumber. It is certainly exist. All that I've found is https://sebnozzi.github.io/82/cucumber-and-play/, http://samstarling.co.uk/2013/08/cucumber-and-scala-play
I've just created a sample starter project for Scala and Cucumber  - https://github.com/alexromanov/CukeScalaSbt
And as for setup you can also refer to - https://alexromanov.github.io/2016/07/15/cucumber-scala-sbt/
Here you have my example, https://github.com/lauriemhu/quality , I don't use tags ... I launch cucumber with command 'sbt cucumber'. I have the same results with and without one Runner class. Thanks for everything.
@jkleiser  (shameless plug) and it even has somewhat usable IDE (IntelliJ) support: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7460?pr=idea
Thanks @alexromanov, I will look at your code and your \Cucumber meets Scala\. And thanks @danielwegener, whenever I go for IntelliJ.
Hi All, I'm wondering if it's possible share step definitions between projects? E.g. like a common project for other project. Can someone please point me  to an example?
Is anyone having this error when using Picocontainer with a constructor having a String?\n\3 satisfiable constructors is too many for 'class java.lang.String\
@alayor that's PicoContainer saying \I don't know what string to pass in here - let me see if I can construct one myself from the other  components I know about. And then it blows up because it has too many choices. Did you consider where that string constructor argument would come from?
@aslakhellesoy  I have a model class which has a constructor with a String parameter. I am trying to inject this object in some of the steps. In fact something similar happens with most of the wrapper types in Java (Integer, Boolean, Double, Character).   I think the class PicoFactory could provide constructors by default for this type of parameters.
I wonder if you want me to create an issue and provide a PR with a solution.
You could reproduce this problem if you add the following code to PicoFactoryTest:\n```java\n @Test\n    public void shouldGetStringInstance() {\n        // Given\n        factory.addClass(String.class);\n\n        // When\n        factory.start();\n        String str = factory.getInstance(String.class);\n\n        // Then\n        assertNotNull(str);\n    }\n```
I don't think pico should make up primitive values to satisfy your constructors. Provide empty constructors instead, delegating to your string constructor.
I understand your point and as you mention correctly in your comment in #1045, maybe this shouldn't be a PR to picocontainer.\nHowever, picocontainer provides functionality to specify parameters for a particular class ([MutablePicoContainer.java](https://github.com/picocontainer/PicoContainer2/blob/master/pico/container/src/java/org/picocontainer/MutablePicoContainer.java)).\nI think this functionality is to prevent this kind of problems when multiple constructors are satisfiable. Shouldn't we make use of this functionalty?
It is true that `MutablePicoContainer` allows specifying constructor parameters for certain constructors. The intention was always that this functionality should only be used to control how your _own_ classes are instantiated. In other words, it\u2019s ok to use it if you are also in control over the classes it\u2019s used against. In practice I never passed parameters to `addComponent`, I prefer default constructors instead. In any case, it would be wrong for Cucumber to make assumptions about what primitive values to pass into the constructors of _users\u2019_ classes (classes we don\u2019t own). Aren\u2019t you able to define a default (empty) constructor to the class in question instead?
In fact the problem is not about not able to create a default constructor. My intention was to provide the posibility to specify default values for wrapper classes given that we don't have access to these classes and they are very probable to be used in constructors.\n\nWe indeed shouldn't make assumptions about which primitives values to pass, but these would be values that java creates by default for primitive types (Integer = 0, Boolean = false, Double = 0.0, etc.)\n\nBy doing this we could have the posibility to inject immutable classes (that shouldn't have public default constructors).
I understand the this is not a common problem for many people, so for the time being I'll use a default constructor.
So you're testing classes you don't own? Have you considered decoupling your application logic from those classes instead?
All classes I am testing are mine. Let's see if I can explain my problem a little better...
This is an example of my project structure:\n\n--> main \n---------> ServiceResult.java \n---------> ApiClient.java \n--> test \n------> step_definitions \n--------------> ServiceResultVerifier.java \n--------------> StepDefinition.java
This is the **immutable** class ServiceResult.java\n```java\npublic class ServiceResult {\n  public ServiceResult(Boolean success, String message) {...}\n  public void copyTO(SeviceResult serviceResult) {...}\n}\n```
This is my ApiClient.java\n```java\npublic class ApiClient {\n  public ServiceResult sendRequest() {\n    JSONObject json = sendRequestAndGetResponse(); //delegating\n    return new ServiceResult(json.get(\success\), json.get(\message\));\n  }\n}\n```
This is my StepDefinition.java\n```java\npublic class StepDefinition {\n public StepDefinition(ServiceResult serviceResult, ApiClient apiClient) {...}\n @Given(\^User sends request$\)\n public void userSendsRequest() {\n  apiClient.sendRequest().copyTo(serviceResult)\n }\n}\n```
And this is my ServiceResultVerifier.java\n```java\npublic class ServiceResultVerifier {\n public ServiceResultVerifier(ServiceResult serviceResult) {...}\n @Then(\^Result should be successful$\)\n public void resultShouldBeSuccessful() {\n  assertTrue(serviceResult.isSuccess());\n }\n}\n```
The problem here is the String parameter in ServiceResult.java, which contains 3 satisfiable constructors.\nI could user a *KnowMyDomain* or *Holder* class. But as the book recommends, I would like to inject the domain objects instead.

Hi all, I am trying to create a web application based on cucumber where users can trigger their test in the web interface. Any suggestion on how this can be done ?
I think the easiest way is to call a web service from your web application. Then the web service could call the cucumber.api.cli.Main class to call your features. You could specify a json or html plugin as output and the return this to your web application.
Thanks for the suggestion... I have already made some progress on that.. only stuck in one thing that I want to show the console output of the steps (of feature file) in the web page as well... Any idea on doing that ?\n
@aslakhellesoy  I wonder if you could take a look at the example I provided above. Basically, my intention is to inject an immutable using picocontainer.
@alayor I do not understand why you claim that the class `ServiceResult` to be immutable, a `ServiceResult` object can be changed (by the `copyTo`method). More importantly, an immutable class cannot be injected into a `Given` step definition and carry data/state to a `Then` step definition (an object of an immutable class would have exactly the same state in the `Then`step definition as it had when it was injected into the `Given`step definition). To me it looks like you have two options, either accept that the `ServiceResult`class is mutable and add a default constructor to it, or inject some other mutable class into the `Given`step definition that can carry the `ServiceResult`object from it and into the `Then`step definition.
@brasmusson Yeah, I think you're right,  my intention was to avoid chaning the ServiceResult object inside step definitions an modify it just in model classes but that copyTo mehod could anyway be used to change the ServiceResult object after its creation. So I'll use the latter option. Thanks.
Hello! I am new to cucumber but am loving it so far.  I am transitioning my test suite from Jbehave.  There is one feature there which i cannot find the equivalent in cucumber-jvm.  BeforeSuite and AfterSuite annotations
try to look for BeforeFeatures and AfterFeatures hooks
I searched for those keywords and found a lot of hacks to solve this problem, but cucumber still doesn't support this functionality outright?
No there isn't a BeforeSuite in cucumber. 
I am more looking to have some cleanup/teardown like functionality after all the features have completed in order to reset the environment.  Are there no solutions that could help?
I found a solution that uses afterclass junit annotation declared in the class running the cucumber tests.  http://eloraparija.com/cucumber-beforeclass-and-afterclass/ for more details
hi - I don't use cucumber-jvm but I see afterAll, beforeAll hooks was committed way back https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/pull/678, not sure it was ever supported or still...
 Nice, that was a good find\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc
This comment says that `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` has been reverted: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/pull/678#issuecomment-47223915
I've been playing around with importing a jar with step definitions\nI've got a step defs project with a step defs in a package com.cucumber.steps and the main project that imports that step defs jar as a maven dependency.\nThis is how my Runner class looks (in the main project) @RunWith(Cucumber.class) @CucumberOptions( glue = { \com.cucumber.steps\ }, features = \src/test/resources\ ) public class RunTest { }\nthe problem is when I run the runner class directly from eclipse, it finds the step definitions but when I run it with mvn test it cannot find the steps. Is there anything that I'm missing? Can someone please advise?
I recommend that you use git markdown when specifying code gitter.
```java\n@RunWith(Cucumber.class) \n@CucumberOptions(glue = {\com.cucumber.steps\}, features = \src/test/resources\ ) \npublic class RunTest { }\n```
What happens if you put \<scope>test</scope>\ in your dependency? or do you already specified that?
@alayor Yeah that dont work either.
@haroon-sheikh is the step defs dependency (that is quite a swear word in BDD terms) really containing those step definitions? They need to be defined in the main section or you need to export test classes in a jar (of course not done as default by Maven): https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jar-plugin/examples/create-test-jar.html
AFAIK Eclipse does not separate the two, and if the step defs project is in opened in the same workspace that should be the reason why it is working there but not from Maven
Hi, community! I'm new with cucumber, and I need your advice. Can I define somehow features dynamically from task tracker? Download info from task body or other way...

Hi Team 
Hi
Anyone is using Cucumber with Espresso ( Android UI Testing)?
Hello, I was using Cucumber-jvm with Weld 1.1.29 and CDI 1.1. After upgrading to Weld 2.3.5Final and CDI 1.2, I'm getting this. \norg.jboss.weld.context.ContextNotActiveException: WELD-001303: No active contexts for scope type javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped\n\nI've been going in circles trying to figure out what's going on without any success
Bit more info. If I only run 1 feature file, all the scenarios in it work. However, the next feature file I run will fail with the No active contexts error
Cucumber-JVM 1.2.5 is out - long overdue! https://cucumber.io/blog/2016/09/13/cucumber-jvm-1.2.5
Hi, any plan to support the Extension model of JUnit5 :http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions ?
@Krazybug that would have to wait until 2.x - we\u2019re about to embark on a big internal redesign involving Gherkin 4 and the new [standard library](https://docs.cucumber.io/docs/standard-library.html) and that needs to bake first.
Ok! Thanks for your answer . I'm a bit impatient. It will be amazing  ;-)
Don\u2019t hold your breath - 2.x is probably at least half a year away.
I'm sick  !!! Thanks for the news. I will advice my teams they can wait a bit before Junit5 switch. Good Luck guys. It's a great job.
anyone available to answer a question?
when running my test i get the following which i believed to be a result of not finding my feature file \FEATURE FILE LOCATION PROBLEM\
@No CucumberOptions annotation
anyone familiar with espresso-cucumber?
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)\n is not recognizing my Cucumber.class
@enterazi do you have cucumber dependency declared in your pom file?
anyone worked with greencofee here
?
Never heard of it
Hi Everyone.I have a wierd error saying duplicate stepdefinition exception even though there are no duplicates.cucumber.runtime.DuplicateStepDefinitionException: Duplicate step definitions in com.scholastic.intl.test.automation.stepdefs.TeacherLaunchStepDefs.teacher_is_logged_in_with_and(String,String) in file:/Users/is-4584/git/intl-litpro/litpro-test/target/test-classes/ and com.scholastic.intl.test.automation.stepdefs.TeacherLaunchStepDefs.teacher_is_logged_in_with_and(String,String) in file:/Users/is-4584/git/intl-litpro/litpro-test/target/test-classes/
Can anyone help me the above error.
I'd check if you are including that directory twice in the classpath
@sirishavuppu what cucumber-jvm version?
@aslakhellesoy  1.0.3
@aslakhellesoy To add more to above   Our's is a multi module project.I am working on of the module.There is a parent pom too.
one *
@sirishavuppu 1.0.3 is [over 4 years old](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/master/History.md#103-2012-04-19) and that bug was fixed 2-3 years ago. Upgrade to 1.2.5!
Hi everyone.Can we give tags to cucumber examples.
Yes
@aslakhellesoy  How does it work.Like when i run the tests with the tags given to  examples.How does it  relate to the scenario outline ?
How to attach a screenshot here?\n\n
You can't attach screenshots in Gitter, but you can paste a link to one ;-)
you can drag&drop screenshots
(maybe that only works in private chat?)

Hello.  Anyone using cucumber with Oracle products, specifically Oracle eBusiness Suite version 11.5 or higher?  Thank you.
Hello gyus. Is it possible to get count of executing scenarios in Junit listener whet we started tests execution?
Hello! Can you tell me is there possible to switch with languages in gherkin feature file in Eclipse? I want to write steps in Croatian, but my feature file supports only English for now. How can I \add\ possibility that I would write documentation on another language, in this case, exactly Croatian.
I'll apreaciate if someone knows the answer. Thank you!
Hello, I have this little problem with Cucumber-JVM and Picocontainer. I use Cucumber JUnit runner with custom plugin defined in CucumberOptions? Is it possible to make picocontainer aware of this plugin instance? 
@ktrbojevic5_twitter I think you need to put something like `# language: fr`
at the top of your feature files
Hey there everyone! Does anybody know how I could abort a cucumber test suite from the middle of testing? I've got a suite that can become disconnected and never reconnect to a device, so I want it to fail fast. Any ideas?
A workaround would be a boolean in the @Before tag which would just immediately throw an exception for every step, but I wanted to know if there was a simpler solution that would skip the following features/scenarios entirely.
Actually I just realized that I would need to find a way to catch the exception in the @After step, which I don't know how to do yet. Once I catch the exception, if it is the correct exception, then either Cucumber.SuperAbort() or just set Boolean EverythingIsGoingToFail = true; and work with that...
Does anybody here know if I can access the rescued/caught exception in the @After step?
@gwpantazes There is no global abort functionality I'm afraid. Create a feature request?
Hi guys. I'm a little stumped with something. Very briefly I am using cucumber-guice for DI and needing to use my own `InjectorSource`. Looking at the docs it states:\n\n> Cucumber needs to know where to find the cucumber.runtime.java.guice.InjectorSource that it will use. You should create a properties file called cucumber-guice.properties and place it in the root of the classpath. The file should contain a single property key called guice.injector-source with a value equal to the fully qualified name of the cucumber.runtime.java.guice.InjectorSource. For example: guice.injector-source=com.company.YourInjectorSource\n\nWell looking at the code it's actually simply looking for an environment variable not loading the properties file. Am I missing something?\n\n```java\n    public static final String GUICE_INJECTOR_SOURCE_KEY = \guice.injector-source\;\n    private final Env env;\n\n    public InjectorSourceFactory(Env env) {\n        this.env = env;\n    }\n\n    public InjectorSource create() {\n        String injectorSourceClassName = env.get(GUICE_INJECTOR_SOURCE_KEY);\n        if (injectorSourceClassName == null) {\n            return createDefaultScenarioModuleInjectorSource();\n        } else {\n            return instantiateUserSpecifiedInjectorSource(injectorSourceClassName);\n        }\n    }\n```
Problem solved, seems like the documentation was outdated. Entered issue: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues/1074
Hi guys!  I wonder if there is any tool to create wiki pages that run Cucumber tests similar what [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org/FitNesseFeatures) does. 
What's the downside to Fitnesse?
Well I don't know much about Fitnesse, I just learned it has a way to create acceptance test using a wiki page and run them. And was wondering if Cucumber has something similar.
Or maybe there is a way to call cucumber scenarios from fitnesse?
If Fitnesse runs as a jar, it may be possible... I'm not familiar with Fitnesse. You know that Cucumber typically works by writing Feature files in plain english with scenarios as test cases?
If it's possible to maintain the feature files in a wiki ==> send them to cucumber for running, then maybe that's the ticket
So, there isn't any tool in cucumber repo that shows this scenarios in a web page right?
In my personal work experience, no, but Cucumber can easily generate html reports that are viewable as a web page. So if you just need the results to show, maybe that will work
Ok, thanks George. I was more searching for a way not only to read but to modify and run these scenarios in just one place
Hopefully somebody else has some good knowledge
@alayor I believe Cucumber Pro (https://cucumber.io/pro) is what you want. It's a commercial offering but it shouldn't be a problem in an organisation to pay for such tool.
Hi guys. A quick question about cucumber for java: how project should be structured in order to run  single scenario or a whole feature from Intellij Idea IDE just from the feature file? For now it looses glue - and I should manually add it for all run configurations. Thanks all of you in advance. 
@alexromanov \ncheckout this link - https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/examples
it has many different examples on structuring the project to run cucumber 
it was very helpful for us when we were setting up our project to run cucumber + testNG
Also consider the Cucumber plugin for IntelliJ, which lets you run single scenarios or features by a context-click menu. 
Does anybody know how, for the purposes of logging, I can print the stack trace of the exception that caused Cucumber to fail the current scenario? It's fine that Cucumber fails because of the exception, but I'd like to log the stack trace as soon as it happens, in addition to looking at the cucumber reports
Cucumber picks up the exception and never gives it back, unless I'm just unaware of the java API call I need
Hi to all. Have a question about cucumber for java: is there a possibility to retrieve list of scenarios with all attributes (name, tags) at the moment of run starting? Thanks in advance.
Don't think that is possible. Why do you want to do that?
For instance,  i have marked each test by the custom tag. At the moment of suite starting i want to get list of scenarios, which will be executed. For each scenario i will process content of custom tag and perform some actions in the separate thread.
@henrylilucas I think cucumber reporting is going to be the closest thing as far as a list of tags and scenarios go. You could implement your own annotations by extending cucumber
Because if you want to do custom functionality by tags, you're going to have to use reflection. 
Hi guys. How to generate cucumber report by tags(which defined under the scenarios) through the report josn files under Jenkins? 
Jenkins has a plugin for cucumber reporting, have you installed that?
Yeah, I have installed it.
[![blob](https://files.gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/Df85/thumb/blob.png)](https://files.gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/Df85/blob)
Oh, if that's working, do the tags not show up in their own tab?
The tag just used how to distinguish the test suits. right? the tag not used for cacluating the test result
You can run a subset of your test suite by providing tags to the cucumber options, but it should also show results by tags in the report. At least, that's how it is for me and i don't think my team has done any modification of the default report.
[![Screen Shot 2016-11-16 at 10.13.07 PM.png](https://files.gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/X5EO/thumb/Screen-Shot-2016-11-16-at-10.13.07-PM.png)](https://files.gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/X5EO/Screen-Shot-2016-11-16-at-10.13.07-PM.png)
If our Cucumber reports differ, maybe a clue is that my team recently updated to the newest version of the plugin. If that doesn't help, I'm sorry, I don't know enough about it...
Thanks for your support!
I'm trying to validate a personalized message based on a data table from the when step. What would be the best way to get this tables information to the then step?
i.e. I'm checking if when a user clicks on a montly page they actually move to the monthly page
I don't think a Data Table is the right tool for this. For what you are trying to do, a Scenario Outline sounds more appropriate.
This said, you might NOT want to test all combinations. Is one month different from any other? Are you testing different behaviour every time or are you testing message strings?
@enterazi What's greencofee?
is possible to use cucumber with c#?
@soniacepedano SpecFlow can be used for .NET~Cucumber implementation 
@loki-tailor Refer : http://www.specflow.org/ for more info
Hi, i would like to execute cucumber scenarios in parallel using testng, how can i achieve this?
@Divyesh85 there is no native support for parallel execution yet
@Divyesh85 , you can use testNG runner to invoke all cucumber runner.. but it will ruined ur results
Running in parallel is not the solution to slow scenarios. Even if Cucumber supported it natively, it will inevitably lead to new, worse problems
When you run scenarios in parallel they are likely to stomp over each others' data, which will lead to non-predictable results. Your tests will sometimes pass and sometimes fail, and it will be different each time.
The solution to the problem is to make the scenarios fast, so you don't need to run them in parallel.
If you have 45 min to spare I have explained how here: https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8567-testable-software-architecture 
@aslakhellesoy I'm watching your talk on testable software and I have a question. What advice would you give to testers who are doing black-box acceptance testing on an application? It seems like a testing strategy counter to what you suggest in the talk, which is tests that run in milliseconds and are presumably integrated with the project code. Would the best case scenario be having access to the code base, in order to get those fast and accurate test results?\nIt's interesting, because I've only recently gotten into the field of automated testing, and your talk of BDD and millisecond time tests is actually a new concept to me. Very cool!
Hi. Could someone tell me how to specify a list of values in a step definition? My example is that I want something like ... When I invoke method \foo\ with parameters \a\ \b\ \c\
I did try specifiing (.*) in my step definition annotation as per the docs, but cucumber runtime did not match it apparently since it made a suggestion to add a step definition listing a specific number of parameters
@gwpantazes In that talk I argue that fast automated tests can only be achieved when they are written by the same people who write the SUT/production code (programmers). Even if you managed to get access to the code, it would most likely have to be modified in order to decouple slow dependencies, which typically only programmers can do.
Hi, I am getting cucumber.runtime.AmbiguousStepDefinitionsException
As like \n\ncucumber.runtime.AmbiguousStepDefinitionsException: \u273d.Then I should validate clubcard points with Api response(features/sanity.feature:32) matches more than one step definition:\n  ^I should validate ([^\]*) with Api response$ in OffersSteps.iShouldValidateWithApiResponse(String)\n  ^I should validate clubcard points with Api response$ in HomeSteps.iShouldValidateClubcardPointsWithApiResponse()\n
When i get the same in Ruby while using calabash i used to solve it by adding the guess mode command \--guess\ in run command
There is no \--guess\ option in Cucumber-JVM
Hello everybody! I'm considering using this chatroom as a modern alternative to IRC/Freenode.
I've noticed that it got quite popular, some nice projects are making really good use of it and I'm starting to like it as well.
Not sure why I or anyone else got added. Might want to consider asking first. 
@seiyria Way to kill the vibe, you're free to leave if you want. I'm new to gitter and it suggested me people, probably that starred the project on github and might be interested in it. When I clicked add on someone it said that he was invited, so that sounds like something that has to be approved manually to me. Sorry for your inconvenience, thanks for your feedback.
[![bouncy_by_noshows-d93va9m.gif](https://files.gitter.im/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/TKPH/thumb/bouncy_by_noshows-d93va9m.gif)](https://files.gitter.im/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/TKPH/bouncy_by_noshows-d93va9m.gif)
Alrighty, focusing on making the switch to gitter from IRC now, fully committed this time!
FF is working online so it's definitely a problem with my browser when running localhost
hmm, I haven't tested the game in FF recently, only do so once in a while, usually when getting close to an AB version release day
oh gitter, why black text on black background for the text input T.T noob mistake, not setting background-color
I barely use FF myself nowadays tbh
I don't have that issue actually...
it's because my system colors are a bit different, but nothing a minor hack didn't fix here :) i'm gonna report a bug though
cool; I've recently got into a tendency to use dark themes wherever possible
hopefully that's less strain on the eyes or something
i think so too, alright bug reported
good, I'm actually on the 'next' version of gitter, testing it
wasn't very keen initially to ditch IRC, but after spending whole day talking in that channel I recalled all the typical issues happening around it
can you guide me through how to upgrade an abolished?
@tukkek do you mean an ability? Abolished is a unit xD
in the issue you say only abolished have upgrades enabled, i just can't find where in the ui i can apply upgrades
the upgrade ability stuff is brand new, passive abilities get automatically upgraded after 4 turns (first ones are passive), while active ones require 4 uses; there's a pre-match Ui that doesn't really configures that, so it's stuck to 4; also there will be more details inside in-game ability tooltips eventually
so you would have to skip 4 turns or use the ability 4 times, unless changing hardcoded value
#869 should be fixed asap perhaps in order to make testing easier 
i see, great, let me take a look at the source code for the unit though (love how it shouts it's name when summoned btw :D)
hehe, that should help with getting people learning the unit names
should a unit with 0 life leave the battefield?
well, it dies and leaves a consumable behind
not it's gone, not sure why it didn't leave at first
just like in old school beat'em'up games
still using FF?
no, chrome now.. it died but it is still there, both occupying the spaces and in the turn sequence
also how are you supposed to defeat a player if the plasma shield prevents any damage from being done? i'm taking some time to check out the creatures and powers now
well, the plasma field depletes eventually, it consumes 1 plasma point each time it protects the dark priest
there's a bug currently and the plasma indicator doesn't gets revealed anymore under the dark priest after using some plasma, which makes things a bit more confusing
a lot of small bugs like that which need to be crushed in order to get things back on track, sigh
plasma is supposed to be energy when you right click?
it's a special resource that dark priests use to materialize units mainly
also used for defensive purposes
yeah but that is what alpha means, bugs are normal, especially for an original and complex game like this
i get what plasma is but i don't see it decreasing when i hit the enemy player.. is that the bug you mentioned?
so it's not really ideal for your Dark Priest to take hits, even if he gets shielded, as you lose summoning (materialization) potential and get closer to becoming vulnerable
the plasma indicator is more roundish, so yeah, the health is displayed instead and gets confusing
i think it could be the meditation regeneration as well
that's not extremely important to be shown there
under each unit in queue the endurance is displayed, if you get a unit damaged over that threshold, it doesn't get any regrowth and energy restored on new turn at all
high endurance units usually replenish less, but it's more of a safe bet, usually tankish units do it like that, while other units replenish a lot, but only if not taking damage, so they usually need to hide behind other units
alright i gave the game a better look and i think it's got a ton of potential, and the code seems pretty decent as well - I would expect it to be a lot more disorganized to be honest, considering the hexagon shapes and all. it probably needs a lot of love to reach it's potential though, from bug squashing to computer ai, multiplayer and so on... i still have a lot to learn though so maybe i'm judging things too fast
but i think im ready to try and code some of those upgrades now :)
good ^^
some of the Abolished's ability coding could get clean-up for sure, lots of nested if statements that aren't even required anymore, legacy logic
and that's usually the first file people tend to check out and get intimidated
I'm constantly improving things, so if I keep at it, things should scale nicely for sure
i saw a bit of that, but mostly a code organization issue, not a design problem.. anyway just my first impression of the code base... looks pretty decent to me even with that
the guy who coded it is quite amazing, he's a really great artist and wants to pursue that path, so he'll be able to rejoin a bit later on when the focus is primarily on eye candy and animation
you're both from same country :D
@DreadKnight wonders how to get nickname autocompletion around, tab key not working hmm
Right now I'm trying to fix my profile picture. I did change it, but it still shows me the default one
it looks pretty good as-is nowaday as well! sure it's not the most beautiful game in the world but it's really above average.. have u guys put any though on how ai and network play should be done in the future (sorry if I am afk focusing on hacking stuff)
Which is a weird polygon of some sorts
@tukkek tries to change @Zephyrum  avatar by force but fails
@Zephyrum yeah, it is kinda weird, it might update later on, as they have some server caching
he probably has a plasma field :D
I've thought a bit about network play, initially I didn't cared about AI and when I had offers from coders to implement it, I passed; I think it has it's purpose, for making players familiar with the game and such > it looks pretty good as-is nowaday as well! sure it's not the most beautiful game in the world but it's really above average.. have u guys put any though on how ai and network play should be done in the future (sorry if I am afk focusing on hacking stuff)
argh, I can never get quotes to work properly
It changed after a refresh this time
Still trying to get used to this chat, it's sort of  uncommon
just leave it as it is for now, recall seeing a faq and they said it takes a while to update, heh
> It changed after a refresh this time\n\nquote test
omg bbq, I can't get quotes to work like that for me 
> omg bbq, I can't get quotes to work like that for me 
> omg bbq, I can't get quotes to work like that for me \n\nI just click on the \Quote\ chat option

Yeah, it also works by typing in >[space][message]
yes, but what to do after? ctrl + enter and then type?
tried that before, meh
> yes, but what to do after? ctrl + enter and then type? bacon
Shift-enter, as if typing a new paragraph
^ bad.
Or just send the quote and then speak
tried everything, ok one more with shift...
> Shift-enter, as if typing a new paragraph\nbacon, works!
> This is a fake quote.
fail
it quoted everything
Give two shift + enters after the quote
> Will not work\nLike this
true, it's how markdown works, forgot
> Will work\n\nLike this
haha
seems you're better at this compared to me
getting some advice in another channel
too much shitposting on forums; learned how to get used to weird formatting
@Zephyrum woot! so i need to start with @ to mention someone, like on twitter / fb
This smileys/emoticons roster is pretty weird, why does anyone need a \large blue circle\ in a conversation is beyond me
ahahahaha ikr, maybe it's useful for doing bullet lists or indicating status of something
might be just me, but large green/red circles would do better on that purpose
yea i guess if network play is ready the ai is not that important anyway! do you guys have any idea how to print a variable value for debugging pruporses? window.alert doesn't seem to work
@tukkek console.log or something
AI should help getting shy newb players in better shape, otherwise they would ruin online matches; also AI should do nice for beta-testing stuff; maybe even done automatically at some point
more importantly when I run  `grunt` does it launch the version under the folder \development\?
@tukkek yes! grunt is all about the development atm
will try to make that more clear, I see how \stable\ vs development can be confusing, setting more stuff into place with time related to that
@Zephyrum oh, regarding what you were saying earlier on fb.... those were browser indie games?
the ones that got ported into steam and I saw?
if I recall, yeah
@Zephyrum yeah, with the extra stuff for people who bought them; that implies they used to be free outside of steam or something, right?
no
it was only confusing because alert and changing window title didnt' work but console.log seems to work ok. i guess an architecture overview would be interesting, just like the design page on the website but i think the game should be more mature before that is written, or it will have to be updated all the time
Well, some were, like just giving a head start or the option to play with cheats and etc; but the majority normally adds a level or two
the way development version of the game is set-up, steam version of AB will eventually be a thing as well, the integration with your friendlist or collectible/trading card games should be nice selling points, not to mention being able to play AB with gamepad on your TV if that's your thingy
@tukkek yeah, that design page is somewhat old by now, but I'll get it in nicer shape as we approach 0.3 release, might put the time next week for another writing sprint, it would help me clear my mind a bit, that's for sure, as I constantly adjust design to make more sense
inb4 someone in 10 years is playing AB with oculus rift
just imagine that
that would be awesome! i guess the design is already pretty good for a gamepad huh.. i wanted to add gamepad support for javelin but there is so many commands it's not really possible
@Zephyrum yeah, constantly thinking of that, but current engine doesn't do 3d, which will be required xD so I'm guessing there will be a port eventually
@tukkek afaik gamepads are supported nicely in browsers now; currently AB does pretty well with mouse and/or keyboard, not to mention touch, so next step is gamepad, after that gestures/voice recognition/thoughts xD (and using smart phone as controller), listed all that in design page I think
there is so much that can be done with this game, im getting pretty hyped here.. somebody hold me please xD
voice recognition: please let me summon creatures by shouting their names like a bad-ass xD
haha, a lot of people love mobas because they like clicking a lot, but those type of games don't scale uber well with a lot of tech tbh
the grid system has a chess like coordinate system, same goes for the units themselves, so usually you would say letters and numbers
yeah, hard to imagine a moba played with oculus for example.. unless you're just using it as an alternate screen that is attached to your face
there was a moba made for tablets... and supposedly optimized and bs... but the guys in the trailer were tapping the tablet screens like fucking morons, you would imagine the cracking in no time
I rage so much while playing on the PC, would probably just smash the tablet to pieces after a few dozen games tops
I've played a MOBA for mobile
It is not healthy for your phone
maybe if someone made a 1st person view for mobas that would really put you in on the action but idk any that is like that... actually i saw one fps moba once but it wasnt that good, not even when compared to the classics
actually it was 3rd person shooter iirc
played on a neighbour chick's phone a 3vs3 one and I was tapping all around yet still winning, it was pretty easy stuff overall
there's that Smite game that's like a 3rd person action game, different camera, not bird-eye view
Smite is the closest to that, but honestly I can't see that working
wasn't that but similar
Not as far as Mobas are right now
It kills your capacity to view your surroundings, you can literally only see what is in front of you
the fact the distributor for smite in here is shitty and does all they can to leech money effortlessly does not help >.>
sanity check: units can never have negative hp, right? once they reach 0 they're gone?
most of the time you see your character's back mostly.... which is distracting
@tukkek usually, there are always some exceptions when it comes to AB; there will be a unit having a passive that will allow it to act one more turn for example
I was constantly pissing off the initial developer  because of stuff like that, but otherwise things would be too alike
this is the sort of thing that is important to define because you have to code some stuff in one way or another if you can have negative hp for example... but i don't think that case would be a problem
well, in that scenario, there would be a trigger on death and the unit's specific ability would trigger
callback calls and such
...I am playing a strategy game (EU4) right now, and the protestant reformation just started in Transylvania somehow. >.>
oki, anyway you are a programmer as well so i shouldn't be saying obvious stuff :P
@Zephyrum yeah, googled that when you mentioned, is it kinda like civilizations?
Some people would say so; not much
Buuut comparing it to other famous strategy games
Civilization is probably the closest
@tukkek yeah but I'm a crappy programmer, can't manage to code AB gameplay properly for now, or things would have been way further ahead
I wanted to convert Sweden to protestant, but the goddamn protestantism spawned on the other end of Europe. #ThanksGame
@Zephyrum haven't really played any of the civilization games myself :/ so many good old school games mentioned today that I haven't touched, only researched
pretty much, you have this huge world map divided in provinces, owned by the nations that historically owned the regions
an attack will always deal at least 1 damage?
is this programmed into the game?
(btw the abolished's drawing is so fabulours i can't handle it haha just look at it all flaming and stuff!)
@tukkek if it's not blocked; don't recall if it's coded, but we had some corrections to the formula to avoid ending up with NaN and have playtest ruined thanks to badly coded effects and scenarios
> (btw the abolished's drawing is so fabulours i can't handle it haha just look at it all flaming and stuff!)\n\n^ perfect depiction of me when I first saw the drawings
good, cause he's a Pride creature after all, @tukkek - might even be might favorite unit xD
hahaha i'm loving it. @DreadKnight  ok, this can be changed later as well, i was just wondering if i did my math wrong
so yeah, those flames, kinda like a peacock I guess
you were assigned with Uncle Fungus, @tukkek ?
And then it plays out with historical stuff and so on; empires powerful at the time like France and the turks tend to grow quickly while nations who fell like the byzantine empire dies early on; however, this game always finds a way to screw up history and have something stupid happen xD
Like appearently having Martin Luther be born in romania, but hey... It's still fun :p 
@Zephyrum It would be too predictable otherwise, I think it's interesting to ponder on the idea of history changing course even a little.... the huge consequences...
aww hungary converted transylvania back into catholic xd
the most obnoxious possible spawns for protestantism ever in this game - transylvania, hungary, sweden and normandy, but nothing in germany...
there isn't too much catholicism around here, I'm not religious person, but catholicism seems like the nicer branch compared to ortodoxism which is popular around here (too many icons and expensive looking material crapware) @Zephyrum 
Maybe why Germany worshipped a person like a god; different type of mindset regarding religion xD
romania is still orthodox in this period
talks about religion kinda make me think about Star Wars...
well, sorta; transylvania is part of hungary and is mostly catholic, and then the coast of wallachia is under turkish rule
Valahia, yeah
funny seeing different spellings of the same thing
@DreadKnight dark priest
oh, that was my second guess
good, I'm confident you'll manage; he's most used after all, so it's important xD
his changes aren't too big, but have a lot of impact on gameplay
it's almost done :)
@DreadKnight you're in the wrong neighborhood https://i.gyazo.com/75a78c223ed7aecdacc64f5bfaed976a.png
Oh, nice; the chat inlines image links
And doesn't crop it!
Yeah, nice upgrade compared to most IRC clients
@tukkek should have picked a harder one, haha; some of the other ones will probably intimidate some less chatty coders for sure
hopefully i'll be able to add a little convenience feature after that is done
still wondering how the turks aren't snowballing into europe nor asia, but I'm not complaining :p 
the edit feature here is pretty nice, lack of sleep makes me a bad typer :P
up arrow like on skype, @tukkek 
yeah, I always like to edit stuff xD
@Zephyrum as a history buff that you are, you'll probably love the eventual Kingdom Wars AB mode
woot nice
so there will actually be a mode in which you can make your kingdom great again? :p 
@Zephyrum 7 realms, so up to 7 players can join forces for up to a month, each having a different sin, you build dwellings to generate units; but you can attack other player dwellings to sabotage their production; you can also help out allies; and you have a lot of skills to choose from, that either help economy or combat
going deeper into the homm3 playing style I guess
sounds nice though
been a while since I last played homm3; got a new monitor and it looks a-w-f-u-l because the screen won't resize and the game doesn't have an option to change screen size :/
yeah, figured that the unit dwelling modeled would be the first step towards HoMM3 
there's a HD mod for HoMM3 for that scenario
allows you to set a modern resolution to the game
also, the vanilla version got a real HD remake
I'm not buying that
It goes for the price of the full game on gog.com
no armageddon's blade, no random map generator.
ikr, lame; a lot of fans hate the price tag and greediness
AND on gog.com they sometimes give you free games when you buy it
I got sim city 3000 for it
nice :)
the HD remake is nice I guess
but not good enough
it did make some units look less like there's a fog over them
indeed
was strange to see that some of the units were made from parts, heh
But no real big change; animations still very similar and stuff. All of that, and you get to miss out the two expansions and the ease to mod the game
anyway, gameplay is really flawed to me, easy to exploit AI and such
even the non-symmetry of the combat field itself, one of the sides a big advantage for no real reason
might write an article with everything that was wrong in HoMM3, could help make some people see part of the mindset and concerns that were addressed when designing AB
well it's an old game
and it did age fairly well; it's still playable
yes, but some new games tend to be made without using the old stuff properly as a base, they skip most of golden stuff altogether and make some new crap that has its own issues
where can i find ability descriptions - the text that is shown when you hover over them?
hover the mouse
@tukkek development/units/data.json file
btw, what is that big advantage caused by the lack of symmetry in the field?
never really noticed an advantage due to that assymmetry
@Zephyrum haha, that was the stuff I was talking about regarding the article I should write; the left side and right side corners have different number of adjacent tiles, I think that on the left side, the units in corners are more protected against melee attackers, as less units can fit near them
@Zephyrum there's even an awesome campaign in a mode, where you play with a single unit and you need to stay in a corner in order to survive battles with 1 hp remaining
so that campaign made me realize the big issue, one extra hexagon can make all the difference
but exactly 1 hp? there's some randomness in Homm3, hits aren't always the same - how does that work? xD
is that inside /deploy ?  or is that folder generated dynamically?
The campaign was uber hardcore; it implied low level units with low amounts of damage, so 1-2 points or so
@tukkek deploy yeah, sorry, typed path by hand
it wasn't me with the whole nodejs and such, was close to scrapping all that stuff at some point because I didn't knew much about it, but I gave it a chance and seen how useful it can be
it's a bit annoying when others patch something and I don't understand the patch, because it means in case of something, I can't maintain it myself
i see that ability_info has a field \upgrade\ that descirbes what the upgrade does.. is that shown somewhere in the game screen for the dark priest?
only shown in the unit cards themselves atm, the interface.js needs patching
also in-game cards use different code, so might actually skip that
ok, i was gonna edit the descriptions to include the upgrade effects but since it's already there it's only a matter of changing the interface later
the units page will show them, but it uses different (older) data.js file for now, will have a development switch for local setups eventually in there
maybe just show the \upgrade\ field there when the ability has reached the upgrade thresold
yeah, no worries; eventually will even add more commends inside the data.json file, kinda like in the github issues assigned to people where I explain behaviours or certain scenarios in greater detail
this issue #872 describes how it should be approached overall when it comes to in-game hover tooltips
ok can u help me out a bit with changes to plasma field? i left this one for last since it's a bit more confusing than the others
I'll try
\The shield is no longer triggered when Dark Priest is active\ -> is this something that needs to be done or is it working like that already? (easier to ask than test)
I would have to test as well xD
easier to test against magma spawn, as he leaves some traps 
i'll test it then np, was just gonna ask about units and powers that could help so thx 
he DP can try taking damage during his turn, but I think DP will resist the damage and lose plasma
also is there any other similar ability that causes counter damage like the upgraded version of plasma field proposes?
and eventually animation wise, it might be a little more awkward, as he would try to move and also shield.... so that change was my latest one and I'm really happy with the idea
yeah, they'll need to be all tagged somehow most likely
so Abolished's Fiery Touch will be done using its hand yet have range
can u point me out to a similar ability that has counter damage as well?
Troglodite also has Tongue Dagger that uses tongue at 1 range distance
The very original abolished was countering damage
let me check
currently there's no other one I can think of, kinda avoided that stuff because it was problematic in a lot of cases
plasma field is shielding the DP when he is stepping into lava (active). do u have any tips on how i can verify if the character is active in the ability code?
maybe check what happens regarding unit queue
\it was problematic in a lot of cases\ yeah this could be harder to code in, i'll have to try it out
any idea where to find/acesss queue code?
the unit queue would decide the active unit
development/src/ 
sry for asking small stuff like that but until i get a good grasp on the source files and abilities/units it's easier to ask than to spend 15 minutes searching :P
maybe game.js in there
i'll take a look thx
usually github is really useful for searching
anyway, no worries, I know my way around the code a bit
sure it helps but if you already know the answer to a question it's easier than searching :)
around line 460 in game.js I think
Activate the next creature in queue
seems like a logical place
yea saw that, let's see if I can use it! Is G.abilites and Game.abilities the same thing?
not sure, some of the class namings piss me off badly
yeah I'm wondering how i will get to the `queue` that is inside Game
i'll try by guessing xD
well, during turn start, the regrowth etc things are shown
so that should use the same principle of unit being active
noticed there is a activeCreature field
abilities themselves have something that might be useful: trigger : \onStartPhase\
so you could have a variable turning stuff on/off perhaps
yeah, makes sense, as the UI for active unit is different as stuff happens, like abilities get shown
as i said the code seem quite well structured, a bit surprising actually
send kudos to the original rpogrammer for me :)
@DreadKnight how are you doing on time? planning to hang around here a bit more?
@tukkek 1 hour perhaps
i think thats what i need
only thing missing is the counter now
i hope i can get it right in 1h
((upgraded version)
i think i got how to code the counter thing but i'm having a little trouble with the coding itself (specifically Ability#target doesn't seem to be working as expected). so if u gotta go don't worry about me :) i'll keep working and hopefully you'll find some news by the morning
you are tackling with the counters until upgrade and such for the tooltips?
no, with the counter damage of the upgraded plasma field
i found out there is a trigger onDamage which is used by the Lava Molusk (locked unt)
but i'm not sure i can use that in the way you've described
not sure how much work was done on lava mollusk, that unit was changed as design quite a lot
(there were no proper tests using that unit)
just retaliating against melee attackers would be a first good step
after that all those \organic\ attacks would need to be defined (differentiated) via patching
yeah the method Creature#takedamage has a 'ignore retaliation' argument so it's clear that something has been done like this but idk if it's exactly what i need here
right, because way back, Abolishe's passive was doing damage all around when actually receiving damage, so 2 Abolished next to each other caused issues
and Abolished's passive vs some other retaliation passive
i think the only way i can make this work right now is if the counter is only done when the DP takes some damage, would that be ok for now?
anyway, as mentioned, DP's retaliation has some conditions, so it won't retaliate against properly ranged attacks that are done at ranged distance
yes but as you say this requires more work, i can try the melee-only route now
that would be just small time temporary workaround; the idea is that the counter activates only when the field blocked something (like a small splash)
melee only is more ok
as it fits a big part of scenarios
the main issue i'm having is that when an ability is used on a target it should set a field (Ability#target) but somehow this isn't being updated correctly.. probably because some abilities attack a hex and not a target, even though they are affecting a target
it's possible yeah, some are area attacks, some are target attacks
because area attacks don't do multiple times the damage to a medium or larger unit in most cases, the formula allows them to penetrate some of the defense instead
hmm now that you mention this i get another idea, let me try: \ the counter activates only when the field blocked something\
yep, that's the desired effect
more desired at least
but if this idea i have will work (hopefully it will) it means that it is only a solution for this ability (plasma field) and not to all counter-like abilities
which is not the best thing, but means it will probably work as desired
also what sort of damage should the counter do? pure damage?
it's ok; no other counter abilities atm anyway
5 pure, yep
Adaptation will have passive that triggers a shock counter damage if I recall right
alright cross you fingers then, if only for this ability i can probably just use the #activeunit field we were talking about a while ago
yeah, confirmed, haven't touched that Adaptation unit design wise recently though, it's still in old style
if adaptation's counter is similar to plasma field then it should be easy to make it work in the same way..
it's melee only, shock damage, also burns equivalent energy from target unit
if I think about it, will also do damage to \organic\ attacks, which are considered \melee attacks with range\ in some way
good thing you're still here just talking to you made me think of another solution :D
a stretched limb can get the attacking unit damaged, while an arrow won't; but arrow at melee range would still cause the unit to be targeted by proximity
the way i'm doing i don't think i can check if the attack was a melee/limb easily, maybe it's something to be improved later on
hard to say without knowing the code better
yeah, sometimes it's really useful for me as well to just have someone to bounce ideas with, even if he doesn't contribute too much :)
indeed, that stuff needs more patching to differentiate attacks better, this \organic\ (limb stretched attack) is a new concept actually
but it makes a lot of sense overall, as most units don't really use objects, so they don't have traditional weapons, but rather organic ones
yeah, also counter is a common and interesting game feature - but one that has it's problems, like the problem with counter-counters you just mentioned
it's problematic, but nothing that can't be fixed
yeah but overall it's better to create proper system than to have to code this in every ability that will deal counter damage
maybe something to think about in the future :)
yeah, original gameplay coder was considering making an ability editor of some sorts
but seemed too much work and a bit too early to get to know all the parameters required
anyway, for now I care more about having stuff working with semi-crappy code, actual gameplay, than structuring stuff too nicely for ideal scenario that goes outside the scope of the game (like for modding / ultra generic editor)
oh nice just saw that melee is calculated exactly the way it's necessary for this to work :D
thought it was hard to figure it out... but it's good news
ranged attack done at 0 distance = it's melee.
i agree, first things first: making a fun game that can be played
and enjoyed
can u tell me of a monter that has a ranged attack ability?
Snow Bunny has Freezing Spit
that i can use to test ranged attack?
ok
it works :D
good stuff! i was hoping to add a feature to help debugging but i guess it's too late to start that today :P
what sort of feature?
would be a simple thing - in development mode grunt would start with a localhsot:8080/?debug=true flag 
this would allow the developer to easily change some things that would help a lot with testing
the ability to copy and replay combat logs is also useful when doing development / testing
from disabling music to making animation speed faster, make upgrades start in 1 turn or sstuff like that
because today i had to change the value of hardcoded upgrades to 1 manually
figured; and even later on, there's no UI setting for 1
if somehow i pushed that into the source code by mistake it would be a huge problem
yeah, so somewhere there needs to be compiled a list of stuff useful for development/testing
but that only happens when debug=true in the address bar then it's much safer, plus we can do plenty of other stuff like faster animation speed that would help tests as well
there used to be lame settings with low time pools or just a few plasma point pools, not useful for real gameplay, but useful for testing indeed
would be a silly but helpful feature for now but could become an entire testing-mode later on
yeah exactly that but without a system for that if a programmer starts messing around with 'testing features' then it could somehow end up in the code if he is not careful about returning things to their original state
i really won't have time to do that tomorrow but maybe next week :) it's a simple thing but helpful but gotta figure out how to do it properly
even making copy/replaying combat logs would be useful, maybe even some UI to rewind last action would be really awesome
for example, having it work with a new file \debug.js\ would be cool so that testers can mess around with it and just discard changes later on
i'm guessing rewinding would be easy to do once we have network play figured out, if we use some sort of state-based system (then we just return to last state as undo)
same would be easy for replaying combat logs, just follow the game states at each move
well, all actions get logged atm and can be replayed, so that's helpful
I should probably mention that stuff in the development readme soon
alright i'd have to see how it's programmed then :) but rly if you think i'd be a good asset for the team i'd ask you to start working on that networking code asap.. we could use it for the undo and replay features as well
plus getting to play the game with you guys would be a total winner :D
i'd have to see how the current logs work though to see if it could be done this way
that guy from London, he's my best buddy
and after a few matches, he tends to learn all the stuff and beat the crap out of me at my own game xD
sounds like a nice guy :)
good thing there's a 2vs2 and could play along with him vs others
I lost quite a few beers vs him, had to put a cap and try to earn back some of them
oh yeah absolutely! man i'm dying to play a match of this online hahah
but i guess once the game is playable online (even if just an alpha version) then a lot of work will come up on rebalancing, new ideas for abilites and units and so on :) which is a good and bad thing since lot of work
people on the bitcoin forum were mentioning this project a while ago and it's potential when it comes to playing for money vs others, especially since it lacks chance based factors
yeah, I tend to rework some of the units even 5 times or more
interesting but online games are easy to cheat, we'd have to make sure cheating is very hard to do
i figure you'll be leaving soon now?
anyway, learned a huge amount of how things should be like, but I need to see connections better, synergies, allies, counters; plus start working on a new 50 unit set this year
started watching Stan Lee's Lucky Man, so I want to finish episode before getting sleep
yeah that is something easier to do when the online play is working.. so you can test against other people + having fun while playtesting :D
do you know about OpenRA game?
yeah, didn't like it as much as the original C&C games though
:) it will eventually have tiberian sun and red alert 2
anyway, they're putting bountysource.com to really good use
so I'm thinking if to have bounties on issues, that way development could move faster
u said the changes would take 2-3 hours but it was more like 6 haha good thing i had the whole day for that :)
well if you want my help i'd be glad to give it, had a lot of fun today plus i think the game can get really good
yeah, it's typical for some things to take double the time expected, it's one of murphy's laws, I anticipated that actually
i'm a programmer for hire so if you want to skip the bounties and work an agreement with me i'd be happy to work a lot for you - but i guess that is your decision as project manager to make
yeah, i'm not complaining just commenting on it.. also if i had more experience with the codebase maybe it would have taken only 2-3h indeed
bountysouce has a 10% fee, small compared to other freelancing websites; plus that fee is taken only when you cash out of the system, if you reuse within system, than there's no loss; using bountysource allows concurrent patching, serves as advertising for the project a bit, invites codes and even donors
it's your choice, as I said.. sometimes many developers can be a problem as well
i guess it depends on lots of stuff
but yeah, we'll see how things go, there are still candidates that I haven't even sent tests to so far
i guess you're already getting a lot of work done with these tests :D that's a good thing too
not really, got more contribution from someone that did it for free and already had a great job
I got things like this https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/pull/855
i wish i could do this kind of work for free as well but unfortunately it's not possible right now.. but it would be a dream come true to work full time on a project like this
non existing code basically commented without using any sort of linting and standards; need to point new coders to jquery documentation when it comes to coding style
kind of a small change in that patch but good to receive contributions like that
it's not working code, just pseudo code
maybe not even good pseudo code
thought i had seen some real code in there as well :) i wondered why you hadn't merged it
it was based on existing ability js file
alright you should have received a notification on your github acc 
stuff even shows up nicely on the right side over here (activity)
gonna make myself some dinner now, it's over 9pm here! can i count on you on keeping me updated about things through mail or some other manner?
if i find some time on the next days i'll see what i can do about that debug-mode as well
even if it's mostly boilerplate (but functional) code
will commend on github and such, no worries
code looks good, will do tests tomorrow, will have to merge first probably regardless
enjoy dinner ^^
you could also clone my fork and run tests on that
or on a new branch on your repository
yeah, I could; need to make a habit of doing that sort of stuff
i had a lot of fun today btw, hope to hear from you soon!
and good luck with the project no matter what, of course :D
awesome ^^ yours might be the first test actually completed so far, hehe
nice, i wish i had time to do more stuff in good faith but i have a project to deliver next week so it will be impossible :/
so things are promising; thanks! I want to provide everyone with a fair chance of getting a piece of the action, so will see regarding single coder vs bounties, haven't decided
and tomorrow i'll be doing some tabletop gaming from morning onwards, so it's good today i could get all the things on that issue done at least!
understood, and there's javelin as well :)
oh no, hopefully i won't be working on that anymore for a good while! at least a year or so
it took enough time already :) gotta focus on work now
i wanted to get to the point it is today so now i can only enjoy playing it for a while
yeah, can't wait to have AB repaired as well in order to play 1vs1 against people using team viewer and such xD
but tbh a friend of mine wants me to do a few more things before i stop so maybe there will be a 1.3 version somewhat soon.. but to be honest i'm getting tired of it for now hahah
ii honestly think it wouldn't be a huge deal to make online multiplayer work with what you have today :)
breaks are nice, when you get back into the project you get a lot of ideas and to see things differently
i'd love to play (i mean lose) a match against you in the next few months or so!
yeah exactly, plus doing too much work on a project that you work for love on is alright but tiring and doesn't pay the bills
though it's good to showcase your work as well
I hope so, regarding patching abilities and probably AI, you seem the man for the job; but online multiplayer is very essential, anyway, some of the important work is there
indeed; when it comes to AB, since there's no luck based, it all resumes to decision making
hey i'd be glad to try something on that sense, always like myself a challenge :) doesn't seem to hard either but you'd probably need some nodejs server to mediate between the players
so it's kinda like kung-fu for the mind, you need to get in the mind of your opponent(s), it's kinda like getting to know somewhat very privately, in an interesting manner
(or some other type of server)
yes, this is why strategy games are so cool
there's a github issue about multiplayer, even has a small bounty on it already
quite a bit of a brainstorm done over there; will have to look over it again soon
full of mind-games and feints :D and some strategy games get a lot of shit for being random based like Battle for Wesnoth.. i like chance as a RPG player but it's not for all games.. BfW can be very frustating for example, plus you spend too much time calculating your chances, it gets boring
oh boy, played that battle for wesnoth game quite a bit...
you even need to consider terrain, time of day...
i played a bit but not too mcuh... could never get into it as much as i did with other strategy games and such
like LWG for example
bfw has nice graphics, cool units, interesting gameplay, but never got the hang of actually getting to pawn people, too much chance based involved
I get that some might find that appealing, like people who are meant to become gamblers and brokers or some other risk takers, but not me
i saw a noob posting about making a 3d version of Wesnoth because \it looked like shit\ - i was so pissed off about it, if he only knew how much work goes into making 3d models he wouldn't even be suggesting that... obviously just a noob who had no idea what he was talkinga bout
I don't like to gamble, I don't take rash decisions, I take slow calculated actions usually
haha, yeah, even considering pixel art version for AB as well, there might be graphical mode options at some point
I recall that even one of the main devs was doing a bfw 2.0, 3d
let me find something quick
hey if someone knows what he is talking about and wants to make Wesnoth 3D then it's fine by me, but if a noob comes by says the game looks like shit and that it should be 3d and offers no help then i want to kill the guy xD
can't find it quite yet, when I'll do, I'll mention you, so nvm for now
alright! thx for the sorcerer king/feudal wars drop-in btw, i'll make sure to take a look at it after dinner or some other day :) g2g now though, have fun and thanks for the fun times so far!
no problem; sorcerer one wasn't from me xD take care!
oh yeah, found it @tukkek  https://twitter.com/LogadoPolina/status/619221963924459520
@tukkek understood, there's a green dot showing up over my avatar around here
but yeah, that's the controversial stuff when it comes to gitter/slack and alternatives, as they are in between real time and offline communication, meaning anything can be expected, which can be a little stressful for some people or generate a lot of chit-chat
you can think of this more like email though and write whenever you want :)
yea but i was hoping to catch you for more of a talk if you had the time
Alright, fair enough, hehe
what's on your mind?
the new patches should help out with ability upgrade coding/testing, setting works now
i'm making a push to github, could you clone and build my repository? it's a bit of work but i think it will be worth it :)
if you have the time ofc
i will be doing some setup here meanwhile
gonna test your DP patch real quick
thx! you can use a --depth 1 for a faster cloning
I use Git Cola
can u test that after we're done maybe? :) im kind excited to show you this
what do you want me to clone exactly?
this repository https://github.com/tukkek/AncientBeast
after you've cloned it swtich to branch 'mp' `git checkout mp` or whatever
done cloning, will try to figure out the branch thingy now from this UI...
I'm still figuring things out, guessing that mp stands for multiplayer xD
could be xD
i left some details to work out as you cloned
but hopefully it wont be anything major
gitcola is confusing me
might as well gotten the zip xD
if you want to down the zip wait a bit further
there is one line of code i need to update :P
i guess you could update it manually as well if you'd rather down the zip :D
trying to figure out why this gitter displays 2 of the same notification
I have unlimited bandwidth and repo is somewhat smallish
which notification?
for this channel (chrome feature thingy)
let me know when that patch is done
i see, probably a bug seems like the site is in beta yet
yeah, and on top of that, I'm using some alpha version of it xD
let me make a small test here first, everything seems to be ok
(so far)
ok everything seems fine
let me commit this change
alright can you do a pull and run the game now? make sure you're at commit `d4f2d0f75a8af3b57a96fcc7a841e587fac71691`
don't start the game just tell me when you open it pls
been looking over the code changes, stuff is in the right direction (except spacings, but that can be \auto linted\ with grunt later on)
oh yeah, this is a proof-of-concept type of thing, a small project that could either work or fail miserably
so i didn't mind code style or quality too much, just the bare minimum to make things work
think I figured things out, installing grunt / deps atm
oki no hurry, brewing myself some coffee over here!
I'm in the menu
alright 1m hold your horses
before we start a disclaimer this is very experimental but it's working
:) yeah, noticed the TODO's
but let's take things slowly for example if you skip the turn too fast or do weird things everything will fall apart and we will have to restart
but you were trying to split common stuff into side-based stuff, which is the logical step
no biggie but just so you take it easy 
what do u mean side based?
like, embrace the concept of multiple players
apart from that i haven't tested very much so i will ask that you follow my directions for the first test ok?
ok
yeah, it's pretty primitive so far
coffee will have to wait then...
pick a number
and tell me
it's not even playable as hotseat atm :D so yeah
1
1 is bad i think i've used it :D let's go with 10 then, start a game, you will be player 1 and enter game 10
just move your priest around and finish the turn
how to enter a certain game?
(im seeing the old pre-match menu
you will be prompted when you start the game (TODO stuff)
got it?
dont summon anything on 1st turn
did already
what now?
saying waiting for a while now
it's ok it should work
i will move down then but please follow my guidelines for this match
done here, tell me if my move appears over there
yes
great :D the rest should work fine then
come towards me and finish the turn
waiting
i said to take thing slowly xD why you do this to me
do you have to type code by hand atm or wut?
nope, just playing like you!
i'm not sure all units are working so maybe we will find a bug with those
but the ones i tested are fine
it's your turn now, right?
yeah
game froze thanks to Uncle Fungus Frogger Jump, sigh
yea man, i asked you to follow what i said to you xD
anyway, pretty cool, this is exciting :D
so retry without using abilities (could use just normal attacks maybe)?
let's try again just so you can get to kill a unit of mine
game id 11?
yeah let me tell what to do this time, it will be fast, just a couple of minutes
this time let me be player one so you can see the other side
start a new game with player 2, game 11
so any unit possible, just the first usable abilities (attacks) should pretty much work, not freeze the game, though attacks don't 100% match tooltips
on your turn summon a swine thug and come near to me
so I basically joined \midgame\ kinda like a spectator, interesting
no actually you were supposed to be able to move since that is the first turn for the blue player
summoned on 1st turn again hmm
i see, now easy-peasy just come near me, don't summon any more units and kill my bunny with your thug's W and E attacks, should take 2 turns
snow bunny is a bit slippery, will try
\waiting......\
skipped multiple times 
then you probably broke the game xD
wanna start again? i told you to take it easy xD
oh no it's working
works, snow bunny passive broken, as most things xD
yay for lucky code ahahha
just finish the bunny and we're good
just so you see death is working as well
I think now it froze
wanna try again, same plan?
swine thug turn came and snow bunny tried using passive (which shouldn't trigger like this)
use a different unit instead of snow bunny, seems problematic regarding passive ability
just avoid doing anything that is unnecessary like skipping many times or pressing buttons while it's not your turn
use gumble perhaps
can you please follow my simple plans? no need to hurry, bunny should die fine
if you stick with W and E powers from thug
bunny froze game because of it's buggy passive
then we can try other units :)
it's not that
trust me
it freezes regular game as well for sure, trust me
can we try again please?
ok
i will be player 1 let me create a game
a lot of stuff freezes game, hence the serious need for new gameplay maintainer
oh it could be a bug in your browser, but bunny is working fine there, let's try once more only
if it bugs again we change plans
even if flawless online multiplayer is coded, gameplay is still broken atm
ok be player 2, game 99
bunny shouldn't trigger passive when other melee turn is starting turn, will test again later and open an issue
i noticed the game is pretty heavy for a 2d turn based game as well, could be improved as far as performance goes i think
yeah, it could be improved a lot; it used to be even worse though 
summon a thug again and come near me objective is to defeat my bunny with W and E in 2 turns attacking
if no bug happens
ok, bug might be avoided if swine thug doesn't remain next to bunny at end of turn 
froze again, because of bunny hopping
hmm maybe something with your browser
here it worked fine
sry for not listening to you but here it worked ok
understood, but some bugs manifest like this for some reason
we can try other stuff if you want or i can tell you a bit more about what i've done
use gumble
98
ok, we count down to 1 again xD
have u done your turn?
nope
im player 2, joined and kinda frozen
i though you were gonna be 1
what now?
i'll create a new game so we can fool around a bit more
join game 95 as player 2
you said fungus is buggy too for you?
the leap is buggy
do you mean special ability?
Frogger Leap
assigned Uncle Fungus to the person who applied after you, but seen no action so far
i told you to take it slow but you just don't listen do you? xD
did it freeze the game?
nah, was chating
it worked O.o
too bad the effects from Magma Spawn attack don't show up, all the sprite based effects are broken now, sigh
even less of that bare minimum eye candy atm
well the game looks pretty good anyway, just a matter of fixing things slowly and steadily
looking forward for mp to update between actions more often :)
it would be nice, as i said it's the very minimum for now, i'll explain better later
i think it might have frozen here.. did u finish your turn?
maybe something to do with the new unit i summoned
almost got your magma guy too :D
was confused, guess MS took so much damage it didn't regained any energy for abilities, sigh
Chimera does a ton of ranged / area damage atm
and even melee
yeah it seems like it does, haven't tested the units too much tbh
the game froze for me here, just left it
probably a bug on some unit
i thought we were gonna be able to play a bit more today :P but at least you see that mp is possible and it's underway! pretty cool huh?
we can properly play via teamviewer provided the abilities are fixed and there are no freezes
yea there's a lot of work to be done.. pretty much now only movement and basic attacks are working
but yeah, pretty cool stuff, it's been a while that I've played a bit, really missing the good old times when the prototype was quite playable and fun
effects, drops, traps and so on aren't being sent over the network, it will be a lot of work to get it done
yeah i was thinking 'they got such a great game it's a shame they can't play it' - this is why i started writing the multiplayer code.. i though it was gonna be faster but it took me only 1 day and a half.. not too bad i guess? :)
indeed, really nice progress so far
the problem is how the code is structured now
i'll write a more detailed explanation over email so you can have it archived
but basically the game uses function callbacks for EVERYTHING
when prototype worked, I was sad that I couldn't properly enjoy playing it with @Zephyrum - his internet was crappy (he's from Brazil too)
and callbacks (code) cannot be sent over the internet for various reasons so pretty much everything that is coded using callbacks now will need to be reprogrammed for internet play
but as you can even 1 day of work will make more things playable so slowly it's possible to refactor things so they can work without calllbacks
i tried using the existing log as a way to make multiplayer work at first
but the log, which you would imagine is just text and data actually logs A TON of callback every single move so it was impossible
mhm, anyway, that would be rather prone to cheating and desync if one tempers with the console
actually it would be cool to rewrite a lot of the code from zero to be internet-able but that would take a long time, probably better to make each unit/feature internet-able at a time so we could get to play the game as things progresses
so how much free time do you have per week?
I've set the deadline for v0.3 to 1st June, it's plenty of time for what I had proposed, but that didn't included online multiplayer sooner than v0.4
could trim down to less playable units for 0.3 but having online multiplayer instead
i'm a software developer with my own company here in brazil so pretty much it's my job to fit projects like those into my schedule.. now actual free time that i could contribute for free not much unfortunately :P already wasted too much time on javelin this year, not to mention yesterday and today giving mp here a shot
i think featuring mp is a great way to get people testing/playing/joining the project
understood, we can talk money I guess
but you can see there is still a lot of work to be done
I agree, more useful than having lots of playable units xD
(and nobody to play them with in an easy manner)
exactly my thoughts, which is why i wanted to rush this first mp version early on :)
if we're in the same park regarding financial terms, I could even skip dealing with other coders for now
as i said i can make a big discount on what i usually charge because it open-source stuff and a great game so it would be partly my own work as well :D but tbh i am plenty busy this week maybe we should chat over more details next week or so, gives you more time to plan ahead as well!
as i said i can pretty much fit as much time as you want me to, i just can't work for free right now (which is a shame but hey that's life)
i mean, i'm working on 2 other projects as well but one of them is waiting for the go and the other one has no hurry
usually moved pretty slow with this as I needed time to think and such
but need to start increasing the pace and have something decent for the \elite adopters\ this year, even get more funding and hopefully generate a bit of income as well
most open-source projects are like that.. forgive me for getting excited about it but i think it has a lot of potential!
so one year for 3-4 releases and getting the community lined up
that actually sounds pretty fast!
it can go well in some poor countries, I know Brazil has that lottery... AB is serious to be adopted by professionals and even casual players that want to make some quick money
yeah we should worry about security though, we don't want hackers to be involved if there is money being made
even 2 nice releases in a single year would be faster compared to how project has been moving before if I think about it
currently the entire code is client-side which means that security is a BIG issue..
I have a feeling a lot of people might end up playing on same machine simply dealing cash
hey i'm up for 2 or 4 releases per year, i want to see this become a big title as well!
what do u mean, dealing cash?
eventually betting on matches will be implemented in game, but some might skip that altogether and meet on same machine, meaning no commissions going to the game itself, but I'm ok with it provided I might not be able to do something convenient about it
people gather around in shady circles for dog fights and what not...
ah i see now! yeah that would be fun, or play just for fun as well
yeah i prefer swine thug fights for me xD
poor doggies
ikr, hopefully this game will save some animal lives and such
i have thought a bit about networking architecture the yesterday as i was finding a way to make this work - i'll send you an email later with my thoughts, more organized than chat
I'm still struggling a bit with designing the lobby / rooms and such; initially wanted random match making (depending on mmr) or rooms joinable via custom links...
\no animals were hurt in the making of this game\ :) you know i first stumbled on AB while looking for open-source tbs games and alternatives for LWG so i guess a lot of ppl should be searching for games like that as well
as soon as we get the game into playble-mode i think a lot of ppl will join the community
will check if LWG has fb page and add it to the \rivals\ list
might even suggest the owned a page fb like exchange
the community is a huge issue with LWG - the game is awesome but there are so many trolls and spammer and generally unkind ppl that new players never join in... the developer has no time to take care of that so the game doesn't grow as it should
shirt, over 3400 people in LWG subreddit, nice
but if you pay attention you will see that there is like only a few posts per week
because people come in and think 'this game is awesome', subscribe to reddit and play a bit but later they find out the community is shit and give up
I understand, I know that moba games are very elitistic as well and most community is poisonous, that game turns men into retards
what exactly bothers you regarding community?
yeah, i wonder why :P sometimes the programmer things all he needs to do is code a great game, like LWG but community moderation and leadership is soooo important
treating new players as noobs? veteran players flaming them?
(light is flickering today here, not sure why this never happened, if i go offline you know something happened xD)
there are many things, let me tel you a few
1. veteran players create new accounts for matchmaking so they play with noobs, destroy them in the most annoying possible way and the staff does nothing about it.. good players should use good accounts and play against good people, not harass noobies
2. nobody is overlooking the chat room most of the time so people will be rude, spam stuff, it's impossible to chat about the game
I considered only doing code or 3d as well, but I think I should focus more on other stuff like design, management, marketing, funding, PR, stuff that's about laying a good base, making an excellent all around balanced product and pushing things in the right direction while making sure it stays on a good path towards becoming something outstanding
just to know that you are thinking of these things makes me happy! so many open-source games don't even stop to think about it
it's important to have a long-term plan
that veteran stuff with low level matchmaking account is called \smurfing\ to some it might not seem like a terrible thing, but it's fucking awful, it happened to me quite a few times in dota2, while I'm a veteran player, I'm not a professional one and I don't want to become one, because I'm more about creating stuff and my hands etc hurt a lot as it is, I don't want to spend energy having a godlike APM and such
3. there are a ton of trolls in LWG that will join a game and then leave after 1 or 2 minutes. then they will stay in the game and do that again and again. in LWG someitmes you want to play a 6 player map, you wait for 10 minutes or more for 6 players to join your map.. the game starts and then after 2 minutes the game is over because a troll has left and ruined the game for everyone
dota2 started doing a little better chatwise when they split chats based on location/ip instead of focusing on generic or country based rooms
and no one is paying attention or controlling this sort of thing.. so you see: many small things that shows that LWG is not concerned with the community at all.. the game is great but the community makes it unenjoyable, which is why it doesn't grow even being one of the best HTML5 games ever made
that player not having enough patience to play, especially when losing, was one of the main things that killed battle for wesnoth for me
smurfing, interesting, never heard of that. i guess on a big game is ok but on LWG where there are only 50 players online generally then it really hurts beucase a noob has 80% chance to play against a great player
i don't think it's a matter of patience, i think it's trolling because they guy will quit the game and then wait for another to start and do the same thing.. i've seen it over and over and over happening
maybe even someone from Blizzard who wants to destroy the game maybe...
even when I got into OpenRA, it was annoying to play online, because is has low amount of players, most of them being elite (I'm more of a tiberian sun / red alert player, but those mods are not available yet), so I had veteran players using rush strategies on me all the time, which was rather upsetting
it makes no new players want to play the game, then the game never grows, exactly like LWG
the only people playing are \elite\ who act like jerks and don't help noobs, only make them want to go away
understood, I care about patching all those issues, because for AB, player base is what makes or breaks the game; while I'm making an awesome game, it's all in vain if nobody actually plays it
for me they should be banner, better to have more new players coming in than to never grow at all
i think AB also has an interesting feature that RTS games can't have.. have you ever played chess by mail or something like that?
I've actually designed a mod for AB where veteran players have a good reason to invite friends over and play with them, teach them and work together to achieve victory (Kingdom Wars)
that's interesting :D
while AB will lack the \play by email feature\ probably, I know the concept, tried it with some other tbs games
i think it would be interesting for players to be able to leave the game and only make a few moves per day, this way people who don't have time to wait for matchmaking or such can still play with friends
anyway, when it comes to AB, it should be a little easier to get into because of the turns and being very relaxed when you're in the mood for that
or even you an me for example, instead of having to meet and play together we could play a match during the day, taking small breaks from work.. could be an interesting mod
yes i agree
we could join an AB game room that has infinite time and be able to \pause\ as we please like that
so the infinite turn time/pool is a bit like play via email if I think about it, hence why I actually left it in the game
while important matches will be forced to have a time limit
yeah, i think that would make the game stand out since there are no other games like that (except chess maybe)
it is important that the player can shut down his computer and resume later, or log in from another machine for example
(for this mod idea of course, not the common games)
I admire chess, but it kinda pisses me off as well (I see all things dual-edged anyway), it offers a 1st turn advantage (statistically at least), it's a bit racist (black vs white), a little non-intuitive, only 1vs1, lacks choice of pieces like deck building concept which card games have and so on
deck building is awesome indeed!
plus it's a bit too \stiff\ and it actually triggers anxiety in me, too many moves to think about overall
i like chess but to play online is impossible because russians.. they are too good for normal people to play against XD
doesn't feel very relaxed, it's stressful to me, while in AB you see cute creatures and effects, more chilled out, while AB relies on intelligence, it kinda makes that seem totally optional, so a lot of people will make random moves for fun
chess is more of a memory game than a strategy game.. if you can remember all the moves your opponnet can do you will win, even if you have a bad strategy
plus chess has too many bots when it comes to online play; quite a few people said that the same thing could happen to AB, but I don't find it a huge problem atm
AB uses more imaginations as well
chess pieces are just pieces :P
(anyway, thinking about it, many said that people are greedy and will make bots if we're talking bitcoin betting especially)
yeah but that would actually help test the game
and smart players would win every time against bots
but usually the community moderator should ban bots, of course
I think so too, because AB is way more complex than chess actually, way more possibilities to think about, so things can turn around in any moment, a bot might not be able to take good decisions as a good player anytime soon for sure, because sometimes you need to sacrifice your own unit, literally, in order to gain an advantage
yes, as an AI programmer i know it would be pretty hard to code an \unnoficial\ bot
the abilites each do different things and so on, so the bot programmer would need to focus on just a few, and then it's easy to recognize it's a bot - if it's always using the same units and strategy
and there's maintenance as well,  as the project will get patched regularly
so I was a bit against having AI for AB because people would fork it and such, but I think it's good to have players get to practice
even if we're talking AI doing random moves overall
maybe a few very simple AIs? or just tutorial or challenge scenarios?
yeah, you're right, noticed in Dota2 as well that not all the heroes were usable by bots
indeed, should do fine
some sort of single-player or practice mode would be important for new players
alright man g2g now
good session so far :)
i'm very happy to find you here xD i would be very anxious to show the first mp alpha to you if you weren't here :D
I'm very dedicated
i mean when i finished the last test i *immediately* logged in to irc and you were there, that was nice!
spent like 13 years on this so far, so it's all about perseverance to me
i hope that it was good news for you today, even if we couldn't complete a match
or even get that far into a match
*very far
haha, it's all good, that match got me excited :D I'm looking forward to be able to play with fans and people I know in a few months, at least hotseat
also it was a lot of fun!! i LOVE technical challenges and getting a MP architecture done in 1 mostly day was great
i would LOVE to be able to make a playable MP for v0.3! i would be so fucking proud hahaha
cool, will try getting more documentation out of the way tomorrow and will put more thoughts into how to approach the whole multiplayer stuff
will test DP and some other patches as well
alright, i will send that mail tomorrow or whenever i can sit down and think a bit more as well.. we can discuss more details over there or next week! thx for the chat today!
looking forward to it, bye for now ^^
and sorry if i don't write or come back too soon but i'll have to rush up to make up for the \lost time\ today and yesterday since now i'm behind schedule on other projects T.T
alright cya, thanks again and have fun :D
I understand, take your time, poke me when you're done or see you around
you too
@DreadKnight test
 @nicolas33 thanks, seems everything is good now, strange
Weird. I thought you were talking about the Activity at right panel...
/quit
Oh, nope, chat related tooltips; yeah, thought you might since you mentioned hooks
i know the front end languages ,so i will be working on the website
I'm interested in messing around with JS code.. Maybe I'll be able to help there. I can do HTML/CSS too, but I think that's taken care of already
didn't even noticed you typed/joined :D too focused reading how to establish a NPO legally xD
so the issues are on github, I can assign stuff to any takers, based on difficulty
for online multiplayer will probably hire a part time coder, as it's quite a tast
but there's plenty of other stuff that needs fixing or coding with js, like some website features or playable unit abilities
@srinjay Been working on getting a unit viewer for the website, as quite a few people complained that showing all unit in the same page is rather bad; did a lot of work on the viewer, but still requires a few hours of js to be put into it if you're up for that
@Zera99 ideally would have you work on fixing some small in-game issues or even coding/fixing unit abilities provided you're up for it
yup i will try my best
btw  @DreadKnight  i think you did some really impressive work
@srinjay thanks ^^ there's way more going on and things can be better, so no time to rest just yet
@srinjay do you have PHP / LAMP / XAMP / apache or anything like that... local development server/set-up going on on your machine?
the website itself requires php
and that unit viewer that I mentioned
might manage to strip out all the PHP from the viewer, but website still uses it
@DreadKnight I'm still learning JS, so, I'd do this as a way to gain experience. If you can avoid relying on me until I prove I'm either useful, or useless, I'd be happy to help
@Zera99 no worries, I could assign you with small issues that aren't too complex or vital; will give you a deadline though
the whole idea is figuring out your overall skill level, I usually tend to test people in action 
I could give it a try. But you'd need to fill me in on what you're using, and what I need to get before I can start xD
@Zera99 good, for the game itself you only need nodejs, everything else if fetched in as requirement, I made a new set-up guide over here https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/tree/master/development/#readme
as for the first issue, this should be simple enough https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/issues/886
i hope you dont mind me peeking in over here  @DreadKnight 
@srinjay when you have time, I'll submit to github what I have so far so you can take a look at it and hopefully patch, will make an issue or more with what's the plan of action for the viewer, it would take a bit off my plate, especially stress-wise xD
i was reading back and noticed you discussing ai...is that as in artificial intelligence for your game..?
@Rogue00 not at all, welcome around :)
im involved with a chatbot system that recently updated the programming languge from basic aiml to allow for javascript syntaxt to be used in the bots brain files
@Rogue00 indeed, figured that bots would be nice way of people testing out the game if they don't have someone around; it's just not nice to make games with other players and be totally stuck or leave first thing
I honestly lack the skills needed to make use of them properly but im learning what i need to know
I'll take a look now @DreadKnight, Thanks for the link. I'll poke you once I set everything up, or decide if I want to put you through the torment that are my coding skills xD
@Rogue00 I recall, though AB get be quite complex for a bot, even something like semi-random moves will do for novice players, think of it more like a wall to play tennis against in order to warm up :D also if the bots are too good, some might eventually use them to \farm bitcoins\ by beating other players
yes..i understand that
my current projects are pretty basic...but they have a lot more ability than i have accesed...they can also be limited by their programming as well as expanded upon
@Zera99 hehe, no worries, when it comes to coding, sometimes you bump into issues that seem hard, but the whole satisfaction and experience gain comes when you persevere and achieve victory, no matter how small it might seem
i could make one for instance..that will do nothing except answer yes or no...or in contrast..one that will chat, offer random pickup lines...chat about the weather, ask poignant questions etc
im building a fortune teller bot as one of my current test projects...chat bot meets magic 8 ball meets a pile of furtune cookies
sort of
@Rogue00 understood, sounds cool :D
well would be...if my files were working properly...i'm still writing them..learning javascript too so i'll be able to write functional files that actually work as planned
@Rogue00 you gave me an idea... when playing a tutorial against an AI player, it could have some character and taunt the player via chat :D
i suppose youd build custom bots for your game?
yes it easily could
@Rogue00 wasn't really considering AI up until recently (want the project to be all about people against people, but heh), one of the guys who applied for the part-time job has quite a bit of experience with AI, if he gets the job he'll do well in that department as well, it's a plus
my coding skills aren't that well elaborated, I struggle for even the simplest things overall, I'm just amazed that I slowly managed to make the Ancient Beast website xD
cools...my experience is small but maybe more than most people...im no a project but im not a contributor...i am writing aiml files but theyre basic and not really up to snuff...i'll keep practicing, reading, researching etc
thats im on a project
@DreadKnight  could you explain issue #886  a little more in detail?
i dont get it
http://www.botlibre.com/browse?browse-type=Bot&browse=true&domain=12104260
@srinjay sure thing, was thinking it's a bit cryptic atm, when you have the game up and running, you can right click to see a grid with unit avatars and on the right, the cards of the selected one, along with a big button under; clicking the card does nothing atm, but would be nice if you turn that into an <a> element that duplicated the functionality that the button under the two cards has (which can vary, depending on the text string it uses)
@Rogue00 hmm, interesting website :)
thats just my corner in that link...but yes...james has a great setup
thanks for the star, @Rogue00  :)
bookmarked that website, will think if I can put it to good use
Oh.. Heh, I need to reread github tutorials
I kind of forgot everything xD
if you don't practice something often, yeah, it's easy to forget, brains work like that
i feel like that as immoving through basic javascript...like im forgetting everything as i move along...so im taking notes...but im not forgetting everything...
just some things  :P
Game is heavily inspired on HOMM isn't it?
where can i see the game live   @DreadKnight  ?
@Zera99 indeed, I want to make a worthy sequel for HoMM3 fans; well, at the bigger image, I want to make the best way to battle someone without using actual violence, but intelligence (like a modern chess interpretation)
nvm  i found it
HOMM was one of my favorite games as a kid, Specially HOMM3, Shadow of Death, Armageddon.. such an amazing game
Didn't like any of the following \sequels\
@Rogue00 big play buttons on the website, but gameplay is broken for now (a lot of unit abilities had changed in design but code wasn't updated yet, there are also a lot of game freezing bugs), in about 80 days new release will fix things, will let know on website/social networks and on the low traffic mailing list, whatever suits your style
@Zera99 OMG! you're the type of person that I'm aiming to bump into, haha
ok sure no problem
xD Haha. I haven't played HOMM in a long while.. Right now I'm going through an Ultra geek phase, Playing Cataclysm dark days ahead and Dwarf fortress, ASCII Graphics
i dont know HOMM  ..  i was hooked on some dif ones  :P
@Zera99 gave some of the sequels a shot, but damn... those clowns are in just for the paycheck and time to go home from their fckin cubicles, Ubisoft tried to recruit me quite a few times so far xD
@Rogue00 other turn based strategy games or real time ones?
Tell you what @DreadKnight , Give me a few days to sort some of my projects out, then I'll look into Git again, and try to help out
I really need to develop a routine here, and my first step is.. One thing at a time, a \queue\ of projects
@Zera99 awesome, I'm here whenever you're ready, sure thing
i like real time  but ive played both...the first really good games for me wrre the dragon warrior franchise and the first final fantasies
back in the old days od nes and snes
S/NES is my favorite platform
uncharted waters...old skoool mind you..ive played the new uwo online a while and its very extensive but like everything els..it gets boring after a while
Thank you for the patience. Also, English is not my mother tongue, so expect some errors  xD
I love Dragon Warrior! Awesome game and music, hoping to make a sequel for it as well one day @Rogue00 
@Rogue00 I actually didn't recalled the name for years and only found it recently again and finished it via an online java emulator
i've been thinking of learning C/C++ or C# or something, and make a roguelike inspired on the walking dead. Kind of like Cataclysm, but without special zombies and such
thats something i might like to try my hand at as well...but in realy into this space shooter/builder idea i have....an expansion of the old pc version of homeworld but with more gameplay options
@Rogue00 provided we're talking about the same game... as it was called \Dragon Unit\ as well; pretty generic naming though, at least for our times
it was very similar to the very first final fanstasy games...zelda like in some respects but not exactly
@Zera99 haven't played Cataclysm, but keeping an eye on roguegames, like Darkest Dungeon for example
if i remember there were at least 5 releases of it...and dragon warrior im pretty sure..i dont recal the other name but its entirely possible
Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead is pretty good (Cataclysm, the original, was abandoned)
@Rogue00 understood, will look into it 
@Zera99 gonna look into that as well
@DreadKnight If you're going to donwload and try it out, try out the experimental build. There are several releases every day. The latest stable version is almost a year old, and is really outdated
its a little inspirational thinking about it...could make a good project for me save i already haveplenty and need to learn to code them to catch up  lol
@Zera99 Usually don't go about downloading / trying games, more like researching and even watching gameplay videos to get the overall idea; seems along the lines of dwarf fortress
Graphics wise, yes. Gameplay wise, Not at all, unless you're talking about DF Adventurer mode
@Rogue00 best way to break the ice for me was participating into a 72h gamejam :D there's nothing like it tbh.
@Zera99 understood, though that might be the case, otherwise no point in reinventing the wheel
Cataclysm is your classic Roguelike. Dwarf fortress is more of a.. base-building story telling game (With an added Adventurer mode roguelike, which does play similarly to Cataclysm)
well, you won't find any random game elements in Ancient Beast overall; and I worked hard to make it that way
only \random\ gameplay decisive things will be ... people
when you play a match against someone, even that you know, you get to know them on an even deeper level, as you need to get inside his mind and anticipate his thoughts / moves / strategy
I've also kind of dabbled in game development for a while.. Try not to make an overpowered combination by mistake =s 
every unit and combination has its counters
If there's no randomness to it, there's that danger of an unbeatable combination , hopefully the game is well thought and balanced enough so that that issue can't happen
But since I haven't played/looked at it yet.. Can't say much xD
yeah, that was pointed out to me before and it's addressed, so no worries
my best buddy helped me out testing the prototype a lot, so I was playing against him for beers and I lost quite a few
I see. Sorry if that comment was annoying in any way xP
put a cap on the lost with the idea to earn them back, but no chance; he's the type of guy that's extremely intelligent, but doesn't quite achieve much, hopefully he'll manage to make a name for himself soon as a \let's player\ or streamer, provided he actually gets the motivation for that, he really loves playing video games :D
@Zera99 not at all; I tend to redo like every unit/ability like 5 times or more; anyway, there are plenty of ways to balance things out regarding stat, ability powers, upgrades...
part of the advanced game strategy will be knowing your tools, how to use them together and how to break them
even if I loved HoMM3, I'm aware of a huge list of things that are wrong with it and fixed them in Ancient Beast
Good to know :)
Okay, lets finish this wiki app x.x
oh, so that's your current project, I was wondering about it, @Zera99 
Heh yeah. FreeCodeCamp thing. 
Wanna take a look? I'm currently messing with the JS, first time I do something like what I have in mind
I wonder how strict is FCC about the 501(c) NPO status thingy when applying hmm
@Zera99 ok, is code on gh?
or link me
I've also thought about the twitch app that's the next challenge. I already know what I want to do and how I want to do it ^^ And sure, I'll link you in a sec, You can also browse my other stuff, except the portfolio which is functional, but needs fixing. I hate the way it looks
http://codepen.io/Zera99/full/RarLEg/C
If you see some random boxes below, I'm messing with the JS xD
hehe, was searching for \bacon\ in the field, but no real results hmm, guess it still needs coding on that stuff
Heh yeah. I'm building the template for when I make the API calls
Looks neat, would give those roudish divs a little more contrast though
I need to parse the API call, stick them in the template, then add 'em one by one to the results
I want to get the template working first, before dealing with the parsing
understood, so far so good :)
Which I think it does already.. .-.
Will pick your brain about HoMM3 a bit later when you're less busy
I'm not that busy, I have everything written on paper. I just need to google if Jquery has certain functions xD
Sine I spent more time thinking and planning rather than coding, I already know what I have to do.. Buuuut it took me like 4 days longer than it should've due to procrastination xD
haha, I had huge problems with that
A pc does so many things, it's really hard to stay on track without being disciplined
i use 2 pc + android to stay....
focused
one of the most unproductive \indie game dev\ I've seen  was using like 4 machines to basically do nothing at all all day
some days i gets tons done well before noon
other days..nothing cept a lot of lookin lol
father thought me this: \work first, fun later\ so if I get to work first thing in the morning, I tend to have a very productive day
well...in my defense im doing tons of research  
i gets up around 4:30 or 5 and work on lessons until near noon before breaking for other things
I need more discipline, really
otherwise I only get super productive when I'm tired of all the chatting/emailing/movies/playing and I would need to get some sleep instead.... of working
I try to code when I feel like I want to code
and often those other things tend to be research into either new ideas/concepts, or more stuff i need to figure out like with the game making
I've figured forcing myself to do something that I don't want to, when I'm doing all this for my own personal gain, would be unproductive
It'd end up making me hate or feel bored about programming
ive got to step out...also wanna get through this next javascript sections worth of lessons this afternoon so ill see you guys a bit later  :)
yeah, I really love bumping into HoMM3 fans or talking with fans or best buddy, because I tend to do some brainstorming or get ideas, so every little piece adds up in the big puzzle; sometimes it's even helpful just having someone to talk to about stuff xD even if they don't contribute much to the subject itself,
@Zera99 when sticking a long time in a project, you realize that someone needs to do the boring stuff as well; so you either try finding someone doing it for you or try to hire xD but that can always backfire as well, sigh... so I get fueled by anger at times and just start doing things on my own rather than relying on other people
which still gets the job done, even if I kinda \procrastinated\ about it to begin with
One person's boring stuff could be someone else's fun ride
indeed, it could, but a lot of times people have their own projects or money to chase; so I need to be better at \selling\ stuff or tapping into communities like FCC
Sometimes people just want experience, so that they can later start selling themselves. I'm one of those ^^
I need to learn more, but since my creativity is low when it comes to personal projects, I never have anything to practice on
And the idea of jumping into open source projects is intimidating.
but that can be good if I think about it, a lot of free open source games kinda lack the marketing / PR aspect, which makes the projects stagnate at a certain point or just move slow altogether
yeah, I bet jumping into an existing project can be scary, hence why I'm constantly working on making it as easy and as pleasant as possible to newcomers to get involved with Ancient Beast
made quite a progress with that I guess as it starts to show off and pay off
there's still room for improvements though, I have stuff planned out 
like you said, it's nice to plan stuff ahead, can save you of a lot of \trial and fail\ scenarios
Ahp. I broke the page. Heh xD
ok, so HoMM3 wise...
adventure or combat?
What do you mean? What I preferred?
yes
Both. Kind of scratched both itches I had back then
mhm, I wanted to be more into the combat part, but it had so many flaws, even though it's more interesting and advanced combat to most other games
so overall, HoMM3 fans tend to be more about the adventure overall than combat; I thought I should focus only on one and do it properly, then slowly expand as the community grows
I really stumbled upon something by making this game design, now I need to put it all together nicely; prototype was heavily tested in action when it was playable, exceeded my expectations
I'm just a bit disappointed there's no online multiplayer atm, so I had to use team viewer and share desktop; or that I didn't get more coders to contribute earlier, but that's all my fault I guess; a lot of people think that if a project is open source, it will magically get developed, when it's actually more work initially; learned things the hard way
Yeah. Open source just means everyone and anyone can fiddle with it xD That doesn't mean everyone will fiddle with it. 
I can't seem to get this button to work .-.
and random fiddling doesn't mean progress 
I need to coordinate every single issue I open, every single detail
Dang it. I still can't get used to JS completely
It doesn't completely behave as I expect it to
I've struggled the most with js, I know the feeling
Or rather, I'm stupid and I set up things that I had set up before, and I needed to setup differently xD
hehe, as I say, \shirt happens\
once I spend 6-8 hours trying to figure why something related to this project wasn't working
Spoiler alert: it was a fckin comma
Always check the commas and semi colons first
so far my ep with javascriptmy mistakes are either semi colons or brackets
im still at noob level tho  :P
I am thinking about those \automated testings\ if they would actually work for testing some basic stuff gameplay wise after patching
You could use \Macros\ for automated gameplay testing @DreadKnight 
yeah, probably
every so often something damn elementary tends to break for weird reasons
now for example creatures are still playable after being killed
Alright, slowly moving forward
yey for progress
do you have deadline or getting some achievement or the FCC website?
Not really. It's self paced
I see, hmm
Might get an account as well tomorrow and look around
You'll probably blow through the first 200 hours of lessons and challenges
They're fairly simple. They're designed for complete newbs like me xD
hehe, well, I had my fair share of learning websites and whatnot, wish I sticked more with codecombat.com though
the fcc challenges fairly set up for newbies until you reach the javascript portion
i had to break and begin javascript lessons at code academy to really start understanding it
the portfolio assignment was really too difficult for me too...ill go back to that once ive bruhed up my html and css skills
some pretty interesting looking lessons here too
http://www.theodinproject.com/courses?ref=home_b
think I did some coding academy stuff as well
yeah, I plan looking into odin project, used to be a big norse mythology fan when I started this project actually
im into norse mythology..im a bit of a history nerd...i actually just wrote a rough novel manuscript....a steampunky civil war fiction about the creation of a union special operations team and a prototype ironclad warship
sounds pretty cool
@Zephyrum is a history nerd as well xD
only if he would be more active around, hehe
im full of al kinds of nifty historical tidbits  
yea...people get busy
I'm a dwarven enthusiast. Love Steampunk.. I should try mixing those 2 up sometime
thats a match right there..like peanutbutter n jelly
dwarven industrial age
Well I'm a fool, I pushed the button
Boa noite a partir de Brasil. Last night here, in for the night.
Ha ha, welcome Lee. :-)
@ctrueden BTW Gitter's history beyond 24 hours is available only to registered users.
And: happy Super \u03c0 day. It already passed here... (not the entire day, but 9:26:53 am)
welcome!
thanks hinerm for the help on github
sure @dietzc , hope it's helpful :bug: 
it certainly is @hinerm 
hi. i wanted to know if i can use imagej on android. I want to develop an android application and want to use imagej. Thanks
@rishabhsethi Not yet as an end user application. But much groundwork was done with the ImageJ2 project to facilitate a future Android-based version.
http://imagej.net/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Does_ImageJ_work_on_mobile_devices_such_as_Android.3F
@ctrueden thanks for replying. Actually what I want to do is subtract background from an image and filter noise and then use threshold algorithm to detect areas of interest in the image. I dont want it to be a client side application. Just need to perform these tasks on an image. Is this possible? Could you please guide me on how to proceed? Thanks.
@rishabhsethi: You mean, you want to perform those tasks... on Android? Or just in general?
You also said you want to _develop_ an Android application...
I'm trying to understand your use case a little better here.
You want to do image processing? Or you want to write code that does so?
If you want to do image processing, you can certainly use ImageJ to do that. No Android involved.
If you want to write an Android app to do it, then you're looking at Java code, which is exactly what that FAQ entry talks about in the first half.
Sorry. I didn't understand that correctly. I want to create an android app which takes in an image and perform those operations on that image. So, I want to use imageJ's algorithms (by using imageJ's api) in some way in the app to analyse the image. I thought that by end user you meant that imageJ doesn't have an app on android similar to other desktop environments. If that is not possible, is there any way I can do it. Thanks a lot for answering.
@rishabhsethi The ImageJ2 libraries are intended to make Android-based usage possible, but has never been compile-tested against the Android SDK. I'm sure there would be many problems, but a motivated party could iron them out.
That said, if you are looking for a \quick\ solution, ImageJ will not fit the bill\u2014substantial work is likely required.
If you are looking to call _ImageJ1_ plugins, then it will be nigh-impossible, because ImageJ1 is very tightly coupled to AWT, which is not available on Android.
OK thanks a lot. Will have to look for something else then :worried: 
@hinerm You around?
Some quick comments about the ImageJ update site credentials.
You can add a wiki user to an update site by editing the credentials file in the .htaccess (IIRC) file of that update site.
Just add ImagingBook to all of the imaging-book-related sites; it will make Wilhelm's life a lot easier.
All right, back to Dragon Age for me! Woo!
hi all! I'm back
Welcome back!
@ctrueden any objections against adding @hkmoon as an admin for Jenkins? 
I would like him to take over the OpenSPIM software, including the Jenkins jobs I created recently.
@dscho Sure, no problem.
@dscho I noticed that PAvel has a GitHub account now! And an org. That is great!
I also saw https://github.com/tomancaklab/git-workshop
Do you want to just move the uw-loci one, instead of having it be a fork?
Yeah, @tomancak has a GitHub account...
The org was created by yours truly (which I am sure surprises the heck out of you)
The good GitHub people have this program where scientific labs an apply for a free silver plan, and we did, and got accepted.
As to the `git-workshop` repository: why not keep them as forks?
That way, we can merge back and forth, as needed.
Sure, if you like! I am fine either way.
That's very cool about the silver plan for academia.
I am tempted to do that for LOCI so that we can stop using bitbucket.
I met a bunch of them at the 10 year anniversary of Git in Paris.
They're really good people.
So are the BitBucket people.
Major progress on the ImageJ OPS built-ins branch last night!
@dietzc I made the completeness unit tests modular, so we can add in the built-in signatures piece by piece. And I split the built-in accessors by namespace now.
Now it's just a matter of adding in the built-in methods one by one. Alison is going to do it starting Tuesday. :-)
@dietzc @bnorthan One thing we should think about soon is organizing the ops better by namespace. Probably want fewer ops in the global namespace.
@ctrueden great. great! great! 
I will look into it more closely next week or the week after, as I'm visiting Tobias / Florian next week
Happy birthday, @ctrueden!
Quick question because i can't find the answer there (http://imagej.net/Writing_ImageJ2_plugins). Do I put the class file for an imagej2 plugin into the Fiji/plugins folder like  for a imagej1 plugin?
It does not matter where you put the `.jar` files, but you *should* embed the `.class` file(s) into a `.jar` file.
(Because the annotation processor that does all the discovery magic writes files into `META-INF/annotations/` that is supposed to live in the same `.jar` file.)
Why not make life easy and Just Use Eclipse/Maven?
Because I started writing the plugin in Intellij....which does not hinder me to use maven. Now I go on reading how use maven to create plugin-jar
Simply generate the `.jar`.
You can ask @hkmoon if you are not sure how (he is in the Galleria, isn't he?) 
he sits next to me
@StephanJanosch IntelliJ also supports Maven out of the box. I encourage you to learn more about Maven so that it becomes less of a hindrance and more an awesome indispensable tool. :wink: 
He uses IntelliJ's Maven, that's why I told him to ask for @hkmoon's help, who also uses the Maven support of IntelliJ.
From the perspective of assembling artifacts, it doesn't look like IntelliJ's integration with Maven is very good.
You have to choose File > Project Structure and go to Artifacts and configure your JAR from scratch, basically.
I.e.: it does not infer a basic JAR-without-dependencies artifact as built by \mvn package\
So @StephanJanosch I would definitely suggest building your JAR from the CLI, outside of IntelliJ. Will save much pain, probably.
Actually, the way I saw @hkmoon work with IntelliJ, it looks like you just have to go to the appropriate \Maven\ view and tell it to make the `.jar`.
Looked easy and correct.
@dscho Aha! View > Tool Windows > Maven Projects. And lots of goodies are there!
Just because we are so used to Eclipse does not mean other tools are bad. Or that we can become experts in minutes ;-)
I know I should resist replying to that. But I really need to let you know that every single time you make a dick comment like that, it is very hurtful. The emoticon does not make it any less. And I'm sure I'm not the only one. Nowhere did I say the tool was bad. I used language \it doesn't look like\ to imply that that was my impression after 5-10 minutes of searching.
Look, you made it sound as if IntelliJ is a sucky tool.
And that was wrong.
I called you out, is all.
You transformed a positive conversation about how to accomplish things in IntelliJ, into total bullshit. Instantly. Good job.
I quickly want to report my final result: I created a pom.xml and put stuff in there. I guess creating the .jar would have worked, if my dependency would have been a proper .jar. Now I am waiting for a proper .jar, which i can use in Maven.
@StephanJanosch you might want to try out the script editor.
It is able to run ImageJ2 plugins provided as `.java` source.
Which does not work for me, because it does not use the javac of the specified java8 SDK
It also has this incredibly cool *File>Export as .jar (with source)* feature that this incredibly cool developer added (I might be biased though).
That's why i could not work with the script editor
https://github.com/fiji/fiji/issues/119
You should be able to make it work by starting your Fiji from a JDK after deleting `jars/javac-*.jar`
I'll check asap
If you get the script editor to work the *File>Export as .jar (with source)* feature will give you a `.jar` with a complete Maven project inside.
For free.
I tried this first, but did not work, so i created the issue mentioned above
Yeah, requiring Java 8 was a particularly poor choice from a collaboration/cooperation point of view.
Since I am on sabbatical, I do not monitor the issues ATM.
You are lucky that you have my attention because of the learnathon.
Don't worry. I asked Loic for a proper .jar, which might be even a Java7 one
No javac.jar found (looked in /Users/janosch/Applications/Fiji.app/jars)!
I have `javac-1.6.0.24-ubuntu-fiji2.jar` in my `Fiji.app/jars/`.
And *also* `tools-1.4.2.jar`.
BTW I am not worrying. That design choice is not really affecting me at all.
It would if I had to take care of users who might be stuck with older hardware, but I don't.
And I do not use that software myself, so there you go. All groovy.
BTW you could easily try your own hand at fixing that bug you found, by checking out https://github.com/scijava/minimaven/ and introducing a mode that allows to skip [this block](https://github.com/scijava/minimaven/blob/master/src/main/java/org/scijava/minimaven/JavaCompiler.java#L61-L90).
This was also in the script editor output:

The trickier part would be to expose a sensible API to let users choose in the script editor whether to use `javac` right away or try the internal compiler class first.
I already thought about fixing the problem myself
Does the folder `/var/folders/f6/6jkf220j46nb7vyv12x59g3m0000gp/T/java5340943230034245440` still exist?
this point towards the block, might accelerate myself a lot
I hope it does, because then you would have the generated Maven project right there.
yep, the folder is still there, with a fine looking maven project
But looks like, that the generated pom is missing stuff like a <ModelVersion>
@StephanJanosch does it need one? If yes, please contribute a Pull Request to `scripting-java`.
Probably just needs `append(pom, project, \modelVersion\ \4.0.0\);` before https://github.com/scijava/scripting-java/blob/32e98b282939b4d29022a1f936f52eef63b3a895/src/main/java/org/scijava/plugins/scripting/java/JavaEngine.java#L703
But you'll need to test that before submitting the Pull Request ;-)
it looks like maven 3.3.1 needs it
or maven 3.3.3
If even only one Maven version needs it, then it needs to be changed in the way I described.
@hinerm @ctrueden food for thought: http://bigeng.io/post/118399425343/why-the-way-we-look-at-technical-debt-is-wrong
@dietzc Sorry I missed you in #imagejdev yesterday. I was home sick, and by then I had passed out.
For the Create / Create* hierarchy, probably we just need to add a field \extends\ to the template, which defaults to \Op\ but can be overridden. I think single inheritance is good enough for now.
So, the \super\ option you listed. Do you see any downside to it?
nope. actually I just did it in the create-ops branch now :-)
you feel better?
Much. I think I had food poisoning.
damn. i hate food poisonings...
hi @ctrueden and @hinerm  I have a question concerning SciJava (and you are not in the Scijava Channel ;-)).  If I call getPlugin(SomeSciJavaPlugin.class) should I get the first match which is of type SomeSciJavaPlugin or just exactly this plugin?
\t * Gets the first available plugin of the given class, or null if none.
but matching exactly this class, right? not the PluginType which is defined in the annotation?
@dietzc if you use any of the `getPlugin(Class)`signatures you are looking up based on actual class matching.
If you use `getPluginsOfType` you can match based on annotated `PluginType`
ok. this is was I experienced. 
Just wanted to double check
thanks. btw. any chance imagej-common with the massive converter improvement gets released soon, such that I can use them in Ops and file more PRs?
yeah I'm gonna do a full release of everything today
amazing. thank you
more PRs then over the weekend 
I should switch to a microtransaction model.. $5 per component released!
OK, here is my shiny best-ever plan for the SciJava display model\u2014and ImageJ Common data model\u2014simplification.
No more Data. No more DataView. No more DatasetView. No more OverlayView. No more DefaultImageDisplay. And definitely no more DisplayViewers.
In short: no more agnostic Displays. And no more views at all. Only UI-specific Display implementations, each of which is typed on one specific type of Object.
I was thinking we needed Data and Views for model/view separation. But we don't.
We can have the best of both worlds, and it will make everyone's lives easier and less complicated. The fact that we have Things and ThingViews right now sucks, because it is complicated and not obvious how to go from one to the other. I'm running into major problems right now with the fact that SCIFIO ImgOpener returns ImgPlus instead of DatasetView or ImageDisplay. I just want all of those layers to be RichImage. That's right: all of them!
A RichImage has view information (which may or may not be populated): position, LUTs, and the rest. If you need two displays showing the same RichImage at the same position, just display the same RichImage in both. If you need two displays showing _different_ positions of the same RichImage, then use a RichImageView, which wraps the original RichImage but overrides the relevant API methods to have different viz settings.
If you need a tree structure of RichImages, then use a CompositeRichImage, which implements the RichImage interface same as everything else, but does the fusion or whatever.
In short: no more explicit View interfaces. This collapses the display model down to a much more comprehensible two layers: objects and their displays.
Then SCIFIO's ImgOpener can return RichImage, and all is well. E.g., my OMEROFormat can populate the RichImage viz settings from OMERO, and ImageJ will use them. My OMEROFormat will also be able to (optionally) download attached ROIs and include them in the returned RichImage transparently.
@hinerm @dietzc and everyone: anyone see any fatal flaws with this plan?
@ctrueden as far as I understand it right now this all makes sense. However, we still would need  Views which are able to handle all this meta-information, right?
and have a nice flight!
Yes, the term \Views\ as ImgLib2 uses it would still be in play. (It will be nice that ImageJ2 no longer conflates the terminology.) We will still need a \RichViews\ in imagej-common that works like Views but supports meta-information.
It is highly unfortunate that the ImgLib2 Views class is all static methods. We should probably create a ViewService in imagej-common with all the same methods. That way, the behavior becomes extensible. And then recommend that people never use the static Views.
Perhaps would choose a different name than ViewService. We can think about it.
@hinerm Did you notice https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/issues/52 yet?
It seems it's a critical issue. Might be enough to add `if (srcClass == null) return false;` to `AbstractConverter#canConvert(ConversionRequest)` and `if (src == null) return false;` to `AbstractConverter#canConvert(Class, Class)`. Though the `NullConverter` might then need to override more `canConvert` methods too...
@ctrueden whoops.. didn't see this
but that was the same conclusion I came to
@hinerm Thanks for the bug-fix. I just pushed a different one that is slightly more thorough to the can-convert-nulls branch.
For now in my tests/dev/demos I will use the current master branch of SJC, but I'd appreciate it if you check out that can-convert-nulls branch when you get a chance, and decide if my additional changes are warranted.
will do @ctrueden 
I'll cut a release and upload it when I am satisfied
Thanks @hinerm.
Released but not yet uploaded
soon..
@ctrueden, what do you think regarding RichImage being bounded/unbounded, with integer/continuous coordinates. With the option of having RichImageViews that do transformations, compositing, blending, etc. it seems necessary to have continuous coordinates. Also unbounded/extended images would make blending of transformed images easier.
So the question is: will there be different versions of RichImage, like ImgLibs [Real]RandomAccessible[[Real]Interval] (plus metadata)?
@tpietzsch RichImage will definitely be an interface. We should decide what it inherits from, though.
I guess we can do multiple interfaces as you suggest, but only if needed.
My goal is to really simplify the hierarchy, since the current one is just too complex.
FYI, my near-term projects are: June=deployment (launcher/Java3D/Java8/OSX); July=papers; August=conference prep; September=RichImage and robust-io (tentatively)
@hinerm I may work on getting the gdoc onto GH issues over the weekend. After labeling them all we can send a link out to imagej-devel stating what we are going to do.\n\n* Step 1 is find something that really works.\n* Step 2 is evaluate whether backwards compatibility is even possible or warranted.\n* Step 3 is to proceed either way. ;-)\n\nI am considering whether the ImageJ update site should even exist. It may be that it should be managed in the standard JavaFX way. That way users cannot shadow those JARs.
got it @ctrueden 
It is exciting to think that JavaFX may be able to give us all worlds: standalone (i.e. external JRE), self-contained (i.e., internal JRE), embedded (i.e., applet) and JWS (i.e. launch from web).
agreed
Anyway, I'm heading out. 6:30-2:30 today since nobody's around, and I have to walk a bit due to bus detour
Less exciting that Chrome is dropping support for applets and JWS completely soon. :-(
looking forward to having you back in the office on Monday
it is sad to be here alone :'(
(See [this blog post](http://blog.chromium.org/2014/11/the-final-countdown-for-npapi.html) for details.)
Yeah, will be happy to be back!
@awalter17 will be back on Tuesday, too.
@imagejan I noticed [your edit to the JavaScript Scripting page](http://fiji.sc/index.php?title=JavaScript_Scripting&diff=next&oldid=13905).
I (finally) just uploaded the new version of the ImageJ launcher for OS X, which knows to select Java 7 or 8 if they are installed, over Java 6.
So how/whether JavaScript works on Java 8 suddenly is paramount...
A couple of days ago, I updated the scripting-javascript component to work with Nashorn properly.
So your notes about importClass and importPackage are no longer valid. __Except:__ JavaScript is not discovered properly when launching with Java 8 due to a bug in the ImageJ Launcher.
I am working on fixing it right now, but just wanted to let you know I'll be reverting your edit in a bit here. And also, consider this a plea for further testing with the updated Launcher + OS X + Java 8 + JavaScript scripting, once I have fixed the Launcher bug.
It will all be moot once we switch to the JavaFX application bundles, but that won't be for a few weeks at least, still.
@ctrueden Thanks for the update. I was adding the bit to the wiki so that I don't forget what I found out. Glad to hear that things develop, I will test with the new launcher.
Everyone FYI: a horrible Updater bug hit ImageJ today, causing the \jars/imagej-2.0.0-rc-30.jar\ file to disappear from the Fiji continuous release. I repaired the update site, and am hoping the  next release build ([currently in progress](http://jenkins.imagej.net/job/Stable-Fiji/)) does not suffer this problem anymore.
The good news is that the Help > Update command of existing installations was basically unaffected.
Hey. A bit off topic, I tried to get started with imglib2, but found a few obstacles on the website. First on http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2 the link to ImgLib2 javadoc seems dated. What worked for me is http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/ImgLib2/job/ImgLib2-javadoc/javadoc/ maybe this can be updated?
Then in Documentation -> Getting Started http://fiji.sc/ImgLib2_-_Getting_Started the code is also a bit dated. The first section mostly works, but some parts don't. First problem: in the untangled version of the \long line\ it refers to \ImgFactory\ but the corresponding import is missing.
More importantly, the whole section \Opening And Displaying Image Files\ seems to reference some now deprecated imports, that are now in scifio(?)
@emmenlau it is a wiki... you should feel free to contribute by improving the links and/or documentation.
After that, I would consider it good style to announce more visible changes on the mailing list, just in case that somebody else wants to improve the wiki even further.
I suggested that he posts here.
I don't like mailing lists - so maybe my suggestion is a bit biased.
@dietzc The mailing list is more visible. 2000 people vs. 19.
(Some day we will solve the mailing list vs. forum dichotomy.)
@emmenlau The best javadoc for ImgLib2 is: http://javadoc.imagej.net/ImgLib2/
@emmenlau The best way to write this on the wiki is: `{{Javadoc | project = ImgLib2}}`
I updated the ImgLib2 page accordingly.
@emmenlau As for the \documentation\ pages, those are unfortunately not tied to CI so they fall out of date. My personal preference would be to migrate the \documentation\ including \getting started\ into the ImgLib2 Tutorials section, and tie it in to https://github.com/imglib/imglib2-tutorials with the rest.
But I personally do not have time to do that. As Johannes says, changes along those lines would greatly benefit the community!
Well, what I said was more along the lines: be a part of the community by changing it.
Indeed. That is what I meant to imply as well.
If only two people ever edit a wiki, that is a sign that not everybody wants to participate.
just because we reported a bug
Oh, you know, @dietzc, as far as I am concerned, the wiki can stay as it is.
If you agree, then let's just leave it.
And as a bonus I'll not even bug you about \community\ and \participation\ anymore ;-)
Less work for me.
@tpietzsch just released imglib2-roi 0.3.2 and also in ImageJ-Ops and SciJava-Commons there are some changes I need at the moment. Would it be a bigger issue to release a new pom-imagej with the lastest versions? @ctrueden @hinerm?
@dietzc We can cut new releases before the end of the week. How urgent is it for you?
hm hard to answer. some PRs in Ops are pending because of the ThreadService issue in SciJava-Commons and the bug in ImgLib2-ROI. Anyway, I will let you know tomorrow if I think its super urgent, ok?
Sure. We can do releases tomorrow if needed.
ok a release would be great, especially if imagej-ops could directly base on the latest versions of scijava-common and imglib2-roi
@dietzc just updated ops to use the latest SJC and imglib2 stuff
plan is to go a release of imagej-level components soon after we're happy with ops
@hinerm would be nice to see `imagej-legacy` released and uploaded (with the single instance listener I contributed on behalf of Zeiss)...
same for imglib2-algorithm-2. Should be released itself (I already wrote @tpietzsch) and also be part of pom-image. major bug was fixed recently
I released imglib2-algorithm-gpl 0.1.5
!!! great ;-)
I wonder what it feels like to cut releases on a day that isn't right before a vacation/holiday weekend
@hinerm Uh, what? Is it even possible to cut releases on other days? :innocent: 
Hi, I am a new fiji user trying to run a macro on images (.zvi) acquired on a fluo microscope. However, fiji does not take the files into account. 
Can anyone help? Tx
@Neofiji We can certainly try to help, if you provide a bit more detail on what you try, what you expect, and how it differs from what happens.
Right now our handling of multi-component images in Micro-Manager is pretty unpleasant; they're split up into \virtual channels\ for display on the ImageJ side.
So, \the difference between logical channels (microscope configurations) vs. multi-component images.\
Yes.
From our perspective, a channel is a camera + the combination of scope settings used to expose that camera to light.
By multi-component images, do you mean e.g. RGB cameras?
Yes.
So you have R, G and B components?
Sorry, should have defined terms.
Anyway, for display of multi-component images in Micro-Manager 1.4, we end up splitting the image into three \virtual channels\ (so you get a scrollbar at the bottom of the image with three positions).
I like that perspective. The current ImageJ2 design agrees with that definition of Channel, but broadens it a little more.
So you can also have a \channel\ dimension that is in fact just multi-component.
And if you had multi-component plus microscope channels, you would have two different channel dimensions.
The main thing is to keep components and channels as separate entities.
Except... we are currently inconsistent about whether you can have duplicate dimensional axis types that way.
Yes, agreed.
The conflation of channel and component causes a million headaches for us when working with ImageJ rendering stuff.
So, let's make a different axis type for it. No problem.
We've seriously considered doing our own manual rendering and using ImageJ solely as a way to expose our data to the ImageJ plugins and analysis stuff.
I thought that was your current plan.
(Which would be a ton of work, but ImageJ1's display code is just such a bear)
We do a lot of custom things, but the image display is still handled by an ij.gui.ImageCanvas.
And we still use ImageProcessors and ImagePlus objects for contrast, color setting, etc.
So, a major thing the ImageJ2 team is struggling with is lack of bandwidth to develop the various IJ subsystems needed.
I think I can guess where this is going...
I wonder if there is a way we could partner such that you guys take on the display subsystem.
I was right.
It would make sense. Your requirements are _much_ more specific and stringent than ours.
The downside for you is that you'd have to keep it more general than \just\ Micro-Manager.
I would love to see more people using Micro-Manager's display system, which I think is generally more capable than ImageJ1's, especially when it comes to contrast.
The upside is that you'd basically have carte blanche to meet your own requirements, and create something reusable for the world.
But yeah, there's far more varied use cases out there for general ImageJ users than what we normally have to support.
My main thing is that I'd want to ensure the subsystem fits in well with the rest of the SciJava design.
Which I think regular hackathons would enable us to do.
Yeah, you don't want to have one oddball component, especially such a visible one.
Certainly we can discuss this further at the conference this fall.
Yeah, this chat was just meant to be figuring out if we'd already missed the boat and/or how much time your team would have to talk with us at the conference.
I will be doing some mini-workshops/trainings (informal) during the hackathon, as a sort of \Teachathon\ or \Learnathon\ if you will.
I will make however much time you need, if you are honestly interested in pursuing this direction.
I'll need to discuss it with Mark.
Because otherwise, the IJ2 display subsystem is going to languish for at least one more year.
Understood.
We're going to be severely bandwidth-constrained as well; we're just two people and the company we're starting kicks off October 1st.
(Did we tell you about that?)
Yep, I talked to Nico quite a bit in May at AQLM.
We discussed taking MM in the other direction: away from ImageJ, but interoperating with it via interfaces etc.
There are lots of advantages to that, too.
But yeah, for the Micro-Manager 2.0 system I've been working on, I've just been splitting RGB images into separate logical channels and pretending that multi-component images don't exist.
I think I got him a little fired up and energized\u2014not sure if he took any of that back to you guys.
Which reaps huge simplicity dividends but isn't great for treating RGB images as, well, true-color images.
We have no shortage of opportunities; we just have to figure out where to assign our effort.
The main thing I want to move away from, when it comes to RGB/RGBA images, is the dumb packed ints.
They create an edge case that always must be special cased.
If they are \just another dimension\ for most purposes\u2014but labeled as \RGB\ or whatever for the things that actually care\u2014then you get the best of both worlds.
So you'd want images to get unpacked somewhere in the camera -> disk pipeline?
Or treat them as interleaved byte arrays?
You know, I don't even care if they're packed for performance internally, as long as e.g. ImgLib2 can expose the data in an agnostic way where programmers don't have to care about it.
Ahh, gotcha.
Yeah, hide the messiness so the API is clean.
Right now, ImgLib2's approach is a special type called \ARGBType\ which is better than how IJ1 does it, but still a special case in some circumstances.
ImageJ2's approach on top of ImgLib2 is the same as yours in MM2.0: pretend multicomponent doesn't exist, and label those as the \CHANNEL\ dimension.
And @landinig has quite a few words to say to us about that... pointed out a few places where that falls down hard.
Yeah, I don't pretend it's ideal.
In particular, support for other color spaces.
MM2.0 is such a radical restructuring though that I had to take opportunities where possible to simplify.
Or else we wouldn't have any releases, even alpha releases, for another month at least.
Completely understood, and I sympathize.
BTW 2.0 alpha is available. :)
Gratz!
Okay, I think I got what I need to know for now. Anything you want an update on?
Not at the moment. FYI, LOCI is currently focused on: 1) papers; 2) conference prep; 3) ImageJ deployment issues, esp. with Java 8 and/or OS X.
And that's what I'll be doing till after the conference, of course.
Oooh, Java 8. That'll be nice.
The deployment stuff might interest you at some point, but not worth discussing at this moment.
Yes, ditching Java 6 is going to solve a lot of problems.
That's mostly Mark's domain.
(The deployment stuff)
But yeah, he'll probably be interested; I'll let him know you're working on it.
http://imagej.net/2015-06-15_-_Major_updates_in_the_works
Roger that.
Okay, thanks for the info! And good luck with everything; sounds like you have a busy month ahead of you.
Yeah, it's sort of terrifying. Even more than usual. I have to write the 2nd draft of the ImageJ2 paper, and prep my ImageJ2 talk for the conference, and prep the ImageJ OPS workshop for the conference. And as you know, when preparing technical materials like that, a slew of bug-fixes and commits end up going hand in hand with it.
So I fear lots of user bug reports are going to fall by the wayside for a while... :worried: 
And likewise to you: have fun with MM2.0. :+1:
Will do, thanks!
@ChrisWeisiger BTW we had a crack at porting SPIMAcquisition (OpenSPIM's MM plugin) to 2.0. We were not successful, in spite of spending 1.5h on it (it was intended as a first assessment how backwards-compatible MM 2.0 will be, and it appears that it won't be backwards-compatible at all; a lot of interfaces/classes have moved locations, therefore it is impossible to write a plugin that works with both 1.4 and 2.0). Not meant as criticism, just letting you know that we faced troubles and decided to stay with 1.4 for the time being.
Hello everybody! I am having some problems with the imagej codestyle/formatter/prefs for eclipse. It seems that imports are reordered (in DefaultOpService for example) and `..<T> implements` is formatted to `..<T>implements`. I am using Eclipse Mars (which may be the issue).
Any ideas?
It's because the import order is not defined in the prefs committed to GitHub, I think.
It's not one of the things in \code style\
I did import the prefs
Go to Preferences, Java > Code Style > Organize Imports
My order is: com, java, javax, org
Let me double check the prefs that are saved to GitHub.
IIRC it doesn't define the order in there though.
Alright, thanks! What about the `..<T>implements` thing, though?
No I'm wrong.
$ grep javax *\neclipse-preferences.epf:/instance/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.importorder=com;java;javax;org;
Ah, but only in the .epf.
Did you import that?
Yeah, I thought so, let me double check
@Squareys you need to import two things...
Formatting *and* code style options.
And then activate them on a project-specific basis, too.
Yeah, I did all three things
(At least if you also work on ImgLib2 which chose to disagree with Fiji/ImageJ2's coding style)
And import order is actually as specified in the pref, so import must have succeeded.
Currently only imagej-ops :)
so, net is after org?
The idea was it would be alphabetical actually, so... I guess we should add net before org in the prefs.
Alphabetically should be the default.
So the question is only: what does Eclipse do if you specify a couple of prefixes; does it sort them *before* the rest or *after*?
If *I* had implemented it, it would be *before*.
Seeing as the prefixes are sorted alphabetically to begin with, I suspect that the config is over-specified.
The `..<T>implements` is a Mars issue. Luna works.
Imports work under Luna aswell.
@dscho My recollection is that alphabetically is not the default, but rather java and javax come first. Either that, or the default config has them explicitly listed first. So if by \default\ you mean \if you remove all entries from that list\ then we might be saying the same thing.
I guess the Eclipse devs thought that com should come after java and javax. *shrug*
@Squareys Sorry to hear that Mars has problems. But thanks for the heads up; I was _just_ about to switch after @hinerm said things were working well for him (but we didn't test code clean up...)
Anyway, @Squareys, please feel free to play with the package prefix config to find something suitable, then update the epf in the repo accordingly. Our goal is totally alphabetical.
Probably this config should move into SciJava eventually\u2014with individual component subtrees free to specify a different one (e.g., ImgLib does this). But we use the \ImageJ\ code format rules for org.scijava and io.scif, too.
Alright, thank you for clarifying, and thanks for helping!
@ctrueden Hi Curtis, maybe you can help me with this: I'm trying to run imagej from eclipse, but it does not load the script editor (it does not exist under File > New >... ) How do I need to configure eclipse to load it from my local imagej-ui-swing project?
Oh, and btw: is there some eastimation on how long until we get Java 8 ? :)
@Squareys Whether the Script Editor is present will depend on what is on the runtime classpath of your execution.
If you run ImageJ2 (actually run the app distro) and press L for command finder and type \Script...\ you will see that the command is in net.imagej.ui.swing.script.ScriptEditor.
Which is in...
...imagej-ui-swing. Which implies it should always be there if you launch an ImageJ app from that project.
Where is your main method located?
For interactive testing, there is a ScriptEditorTestDrive in that project which you can run that pops it up.
Is that good enough?
As for Java 8: what are you asking? When will there be a downloadable version of ImageJ2 and/or Fiji bundled with Java 8 instead of Java 6?
Or: when will you be able to start using Java 8 APIs with your code
For the former: by end of fall.
For the latter: unlikely before next year, since ditching Java 6 will have serious consequences.
@ctrueden I cannot use ScriptEditorTestDrive for https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ui-swing/issues/52. It cannot reproduce the bug.
I have been using ScriptEditorTestDrive already for the script-editor rework. It would have been mad not to test if things still work after I refactored (which is why I did for almost all commits).
Regarding Java 8: Only the Java 8 APIs really affect me :) What consequences will there be? Is this something one could work on on the next hackathon
@ctrueden, looks like the latest continuous release of Fiji still has imagej-ops 0.15.x, I think we will need 0.16.x for the OPS workshop.
@bnorthan absolutely!
@bnorthan Thanks, will definitely upgrade that before the end of the week, then.
@bnorthan I decided to start shipping imagej-tutorials with ImageJ2. Gonna divide them into beginner, intermediate and advanced topics. The goal is for all the tutorials to simply be in Templates > Tutorials in the Script Editor.
@Squareys For launching a \full\ ImageJ with everything on the classpath, you can add a test-scope dep on net.imagej:imagej and then call `net.imagej.Main.launch(args)` to launch it.
@Squareys Regarding consequences of allowing Java 8 APIs, major ramifications include: 1) no more support for older OS X machines; 2) ImageJ being super slow and crappy on OS X, because apparently Oracle J7 and J8 make ImageJ laggy, slow and crashy compared to Apple J6 (so report many users, anyway); 3) broken upgrade paths for existing Fiji installations bundled with Java 1.6.0_24. To address (3) we need to improve the ImageJ Updater to be smart enough to upgrade your JVM for you\u2014or at least to tell you that it can't, and that you need to do it yourself.
@hinerm Behold! https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/commit/8166d835d66cc4735b177e7780aaadf73b32d2d9
@ctrueden Am I supposed to merge the scripteditor changes myself or will you do so?
Maybe one could close the Milestone \Required for ImageJ 2.0.0\? It's past due ~1 year and is 100% complete. See: https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ui-swing/milestones
Correct me if I'm wrong:
Alright, no. But: How do I guarantee the classes are already loaded by class loader when I try to get pluginInfo.getPluginClass() ?
@ctrueden Simply put, I sort all my SingletonPlugins in initialize, but their infos currently return null for some reason, they are already in the instance map though.
Ah, I see DefaultAppService does the plugin handling lazily.
I will do so, too.
@Squareys Yes, it is best practice not to use `initialize()` at all, actually.
Because it takes time during `new Context()` to do all that stuff, which slows down the application startup.
So we do tons of lazy init stuff in many services.
AbstractSingletonService does not instantiate its singleton plugins until they are first requested via the getter.
There are many examples, if you wish to see a pattern to follow.
I suggest patterning it very closely after DefaultAppService. The double checked locking is there for thread safety.
@ctrueden Okay, thanks!
@ctrueden, @hinerm, when calling an op should python lists be automatically converted to java arrays??  \n\nthis does not seem to work...\n```\nphantom=ops.create().img([xSize, ySize)]\n```\n\nto get around it I have to use jarray\n```\n phantom=ops.create().img(array([xSize, ySize], 'l'))\n```\n\n
 that sounds familiar @bnorthan .. not sure if there's a good way around it
there is a decode operation in script languages that may be appropriate here?
I can't even get the `array` working personally, in the latest Fiji..
Yes, the `jarray` thing is a known issue with Jython.
I don't think there is a way around it.
I don't know if it's better in Jython 2.7 or not
@bnorthan BTW, the work by @Squareys is for content assist in the script editor. Java and JavaScript are done as a proof of concept, and @hinerm has been working on getting it merged today if possible.
So, that will be awesome for our workshop!
Especially if we also add Jython (or whatever language we end up using).
@ctrueden no jython support: https://github.com/bobbylight/RSTALanguageSupport
slash python
@hinerm Interesting which languages are supported...
Too bad Groovy is also considered broken right now.
ok @ctrueden how do we work around the calling of `printstacktrace` in low-level fife code?
@hinerm the code segment above only works with imagej-ops 0.16. 
@hinerm I think it is `jarray`, not `array`
@hinerm To eat a stack trace, you have to intercept stderr.
I was looking at the best way we might add this to the `ConsoleService`.
Oh, it is `array`
Like so:
```python\nfrom jarray import array\ndims = array([150, 100], 'l')\n```
@ctrueden yeah.. I was thinking that making the listeners plugins might work, except they only get the exception one line at a time
so you don't have the context of the full stack trace to blacklist something
@ctrueden, @hinerm  \n\ndoes the content assist work for groovy??\n\nspeaking of groovy the following code does not work because ArrayList is not converted.  I can work around it using the Dimensions interface, but it would be nice to be able to use the concise call in the workshop.  \n```\n// @OpService ops\n\nops.create().img([20,20])\n```
it doesn't work for groovy yet :(
@bnorthan we could fix that by creating a SciJava converter for ArrayLists to arrays, and vice versa.
@bnorthan @ctrueden converters live: https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/pull/178
I'll write unit tests for them before merging.. but could you test if this fixes things for you @bnorthan ?
I am 99% sure it won't work because I have never actually used them.. :D
haha and they don't build
@hinerm thanks Mark.  I'll take a look at it and let you know. 
@hinerm when running mvn it seems to fail on the ConversionUtilsTest\n\n>ConversionUtilsTest.testPrimitiveArray:266->setFieldValue:531 \u00bb ClassCast [I c...
Hi all,\nI am new in developing plugins in IJ (and in Java). I am trying to use WekaSegmentation tools in a plugin that I wrote in intelliJ. I've put Weka's jar files in the \.idea/libraries\ folder of the project, and  it seems that importing trainableSegmentation.* works.. \nHowever, when I try to debug I get the following exception - \n[WARNING] No appropriate format found: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: weka.core.Instance
Did I mess up the include/import procedure?
@bnorthan\n\n ```\n# @OpService ops\n# @OUTPUT net.imagej.ImgPlus phantom\n\nphantom=ops.create().img([25, 25])\n```\n\nworks again as of https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/commit/7adeedacdad06f1b595183855416d7a02220e2a1
gonna add a couple converters so the multi-arg signatures (e.g. with output type) work, and so it works in groovy
@NoamGit you are almost certainly missing the Maven dependencies of the Trainable Weka Segmentation plugin
it sounds like you have the TWS classes but not the core Weka classes (TWS is a Fiji plugin that reuses Weka tools) thus the exception
I would suggest structuring your plugin as a Maven project with [pom-fiji](https://github.com/fiji/pom-fiji) as a parent and a dependency on TWS - i.e. with:\n\n```\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>sc.fiji</groupId>\n  <artifactId>Trainable_Segmentation</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```
then you will inherit `Trainable_Segmentation`'s dependencies automatically
@NoamGit See http://imagej.net/Maven for details.
10X guys. I will look it up
@NoamGit the easiest way to start is by forking https://github.com/imagej/minimal-ij1-plugin and then editing the `pom.xml`.
@hinerm So if I understand you correctly all I need to do is to add the specified lines to the pom.xml of my imagej project. This throws an error\n>Dependency '''sc.fiji:Trainable_Segmentation:<unknown>''' not found Inspects a Maven model for resolution problems.\n
@NoamGit without specifying `pom-fiji` as parent POMs, the version will not be defined.
You really want to specify it as parent POM: https://github.com/fiji/Trainable_Segmentation/blob/7de4d94bb7e30ea1a9aadc5038aefd693013609f/pom.xml#L5-L10 (@hinerm suggested that explicitly, BTW)
Of course you want to use the newest version of `pom-fiji`: http://maven.imagej.net/index.html#nexus-search;quick~pom-fiji says it is 13.0.3
How to find out the newest version (and the basic structure of a `pom.xml` file) is all described in http://imagej.net/Maven, as linked by @ctrueden .
@dscho  Sorry for these very basic questions, but can I specify it as parent POM by simply adding \n'''\n<parent>\n\t\t<groupId>sc.fiji</groupId>\n\t\t<artifactId>pom-fiji</artifactId>\n\t\t<version>9.0.0</version>\n\t\t<relativePath />\n\t</parent>\n'''\nto the project pom.xml?
@NoamGit yes.
You might want to read http://fiji.sc/Maven in its entirety -- it is not all that long.
@dscho Thanks again! the problem was that I didn't understand that a project can only have 1 parent. Replacing the default parent with sc.fiji solved the problem.\nBy the way, Can you recommend on a debugging practice that does not include opening a new instance of imageJ for every time that I want to check my code?\nCurrently I am using a main function that runs - \n'''\n    public static void main(final String... args) {\n        Main.launch(args);\n        IJ.runPlugIn(Activity_Analysis.class.getName(), \\);\n    }\n'''\n\n
@NoamGit you could try to run `IJ.runPlugIn()` directly, i.e. without `Main.launch(args)`.
That will hide the main window, of course.
@NoamGit Another option, if your plugin is relatively simple, is to use the Script Editor for Edit/Run/Debug cycle as a complement to Eclipse.
@dscho It seems that Google Code shut its doors yesterday. Several jobs reference it:\n```\n$ grep code.google jobs/*/config.xml\njobs/Fiji-synchronizer/config.xml:    https://code.google.com/p/fiji-bi/=https://code.google.com/p/fiji-bi/ \\\njobs/ImageJA-synchronizer/config.xml:    https://code.google.com/p/fiji-bi.imageja/\njobs/MSysGit-Git-Git-Mirror/config.xml:# https://code.google.com/p/msysgit.4msysgit/</command>\njobs/MSysGit-Git-Mirror/config.xml:#    https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/</command>\njobs/ThunderStorm-Git-Mirror/config.xml:    https://code.google.com/p/thunder-storm/ \\\n```\nWould you agree that I should remove those repos from those jobs?
@ctrueden Go ahead, disable them.
A little bit surprising, given that they promised to turn things read-only.
They did.
Oh, so pushing fails. Makes sense.
It's just that ImageJA-synchronizer tried to push to Google Code due to changes on the other side, which of course failed.
Except that msysGit was retired.
So there should be nothing to push.
BTW you might want to switch the Windows Jenkins job to use the Git for Windows 2.x SDK instead of msysGit.
Well, the MSysGit jobs appear to already have had google code commented out anyway.
So, I should disable those jobs then, eh?
Would simplify building 32-bit vs 64-bit, too.
Yep, MSysGit is lying on the beach, enjoying the sun.
No need to bother it anymore.
Thanks for the advice\u2014I will file an issue for it.
(For switching away from msysGit on our Windows node, I mean.)
It is not critical, of course.
The GCC is not buggy or something. It is just prone to fall behind, is all.
The Git for Windows website is looking awesome now. :+1:
Well, it looks almost the same as the old one.
Except that the version tag is missing.
Tons of work to do, still.
I was reading the governance model page, which is nice.
But now you get $$$ for doing it, eh? I hope it feels good.
It does.
And it is not 1-year contract after 1-year contract after 2-year contract after 2-year contract after 1-year contract after 1-year contract.
Hey, that's almost looking like a flat bell curve!
@bnorthan http://imagej.github.io/presentations/
No slides yet. Making them now!
@bnorthan I have in my calendar that we were going to meet right now? It's up to you. I am working on slides all day today, as linked above.
@ctrueden  sorry I missed this.   Would you be available to meet at 4:00 eastern/3:00 central??  Or later in the week if that doesn't work. 
@bnorthan Curtis is out for a bit but should be back this afternoon.. I don't think he has anything scheduled for 3 CST
@bnorthan 4ET/3CT works for me.
thanks for the release @hinerm @ctrueden 
@bnorthan did my email help you?
@ctrueden sounds good
@dietzc thanks a lot.  Those instructions were useful.  I have some more questions which I will post to the dev list. 
actually I'm not sure if the imagej-dev list is the right place for KNIME related prolems
you can ask me directly or ask in the forum
https://tech.knime.org/forum/knime-image-processing
Anyway, I will answer everywhere :-)
answered
@bnorthan http://imagej.net/Architecture#Using_snapshot_couplings_during_development
@bnorthan maybe an example with Hyperslice + threshold in e.g. time-lapse might by a nice ops example
just came to my mind
I can prepare it in Java if you want
How quickly can you get there?
Where?
Hah! Gotcha.
@dietzc We are showing cropping and then threshold.   it would be cool to use hyper slices 
If you have an example handy let me know.
@bnorthan https://gist.github.com/dietzc/6dd65e9fc30be52e23f7
does this help?
@dietzc this means slice wise will iterate on axis 2, 3, and 4??  In other words 0 and 1 are the axis of the slice, and it will iterate over the other axis??  Did I explain it right??  I remember going over this before and it took a while for me to get it straight in my head.  
yep
@bnorthan you basically chose the dimensions which define the plane which will be iterated and processed
(if I remember correctly)
so, if you say 0,1 in a 3-video with say dimension three = 100
then 100 slices will be processed
https://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/blob/master/src/main/java/net/imagej/ops/slicewise/Hyperslice.java#L71
I even did JavaDoc. Wow ;-)
@bnorthan Tutorial restructuring is on this branch: https://github.com/imagej/imagej-tutorials/compare/shuffle-stuff
I will move all the scripts into `src/main/resources/script_templates/Tutorials`
I may convert some Java examples only to scripts. Still cogitating. The UsingOps example is still a pain in Java due to lack of sufficient type-safe method signatures.
Actually it doesn't completely work on the topic branch right now due to `add(Img, Img)` no longer matching as expected.
Gotta run to a talk right now; will keep working on it during and afterward.
in jython...\n``` python\n\n# create the otsu op\notsu=ops.op(Ops.Threshold.Otsu, inputData);\n\n# create memory for the thresholded image\nthresholded=ops.create().img(inputData.getImgPlus(), BitType())\n\n# slicewise otsu threshold\nops.slicewise(thresholded, inputData.getImgPlus(), otsu, [0,1])\n\nthresholdedPlus=ImgPlus(thresholded)\n#thresholdedPlus=ImgPlus(thresholded, inputData)\n\ndisplay.createDisplay(\thresholded\ thresholdedPlus)\n```
This works with the \Confocal Series\ sample image.  The only hiccup is I can't figure out how to set the axes on the new image....  
I though
``` python\nthresholdedPlus=ImgPlus(thresholded, inputData)\n```\nwould create a new image plus with meta-data copied from the other one... but the ```createDisplay``` throws an error
Hmm, I would have expected `ImgPlus(thresholded, inputData)` to work... 
Inputdata.gerImgPlus()?
After mucking around with the ImageJ tutorials a bunch on a topic branch, I was reminded why I had them structured as separate JARs... and I'm not sure how to proceed.
It's the two-edged sword of extensibility once again. Some of the tutorials add rather disruptive extensions to the context.
I know I want there to be one component (ideally called \imagej-tutorials\) that ships all the script versions of the tutorials in `src/main/resources/script_templates/Tutorials/...`
And some of those could be Java sources\u2014that is fine. But that only works for single-file Java sources which are \runnable\ in some sense.
Some of the tutorials are not really runnable from Script Editor. E.g.: the new module preprocessor plugin.
I think it needs to stay as its own project. I thought about using `src/test/java` but that still munges all the extensions together in a bad way. I thought about using ITs but that is rather arcane and also not really what is needed (they don't need to run as part of the build at all).
Actually, most of the tutorials could co-exist in the same project. But not all. And most of them could be shipped for the Script Editor. But not all. Maybe I will lump together all the novice+intermediate into a single \imagej-tutorials\ and make http://imagej.net/Tutorial, like how ImgLib2 has its Examples page. And then keep the \advanced\ tutorials as separate modules.
@dietzc thanks for the suggestion but it didn't work.  
The error actually occurs when trying to display the result. 
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Stack pixel array null\n\tat ij.ImagePlus.setStack(ImagePlus.java:642)\n\tat ij.ImagePlus.<init>(ImagePlus.java:147)\n\tat net.imagej.legacy.translate.AbstractImagePlusCreator.makeImagePlus(AbstractImagePlusCreator.java:110)
I am guessing that when creating an ImgPlus, using the meta data from another ImgPlus, something isn't copied over correctly. 
@bnorthan Mark and I can help debug that tomorrow afternoon, if you like.
Hi Everyone here, Can someone help me with ImageJ, i have a query regarding getting the coordinates 
Would really appreciate!
ash0088: Go ahead and ask! We'll help if we know the answer. Otherwise, there's always the [mailing list](http://imagej.net/Mailing_Lists).
Alright, i have an image in which there is a crack on the side (of periphery)..i am interested in getting the coordinates of this crack
the crack has the shape of a parabola
and i need the coordinates of this parabolic crack
Ctrueden: any idea?
Can you post a sample image?
Can i email you the image?
Because it can't be shared publicly?
Any chance of an image that can be? A smaller version? Single plane? Cropped?
how can i share it here? i mean the procedure
One way is to open an issue at https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues and drag-and-drop a single-plane image there.
Another way would be to use a service like https://www.wetransfer.com/
A third way is the Help > Upload Sample Image command of ImageJ2.
also you should be able to drag the image right into here
@gab1one: Oh yeah, cool.
like this :D
[![Row206.ome.tif](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/9oNn/thumb/Row206.ome.tiff)](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/9oNn/Row206.ome.tif)
[![sample.tif](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/pdNH/thumb/sample.tiff)](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/pdNH/sample.tif)
there u go...
i need the coordinates of the crack there
which is on the left side
@ash00088: The cleft down the middle, you mean?
Do you need a series of line segments? Or just the central parabolic distortion?
yes the opening in the middle (its a crack)
i just need the coordinates of the central parabolic distortion 
Well, your first steps are:
Find Edges
Make Binary
Erode
(Or similar)
Then you'll have a binary mask with the line down the middle, and you can do further analysis from there.
Press L for the [Command Finder](http://imagej.net/Command_Finder) to find these commands, BTW.
right, im gonna try this one straight away
Then, ImageJ has some curve fitting stuff, but I have never used it.
ok and then i have to go to tools and save coordinates?
Asking about that on the mailing list might work better for you. But it seems like a great candidate for doing a fit.
i have go the edges now, i dont see why i need fitting
i just somehow need to save the coordinates of this periphree
dont u agree?
If you think so, then great. You're the one who knows the requirements for the problem. :smile:
It's nice that your data is so clean and nearly noise free.
yeah, but i still am missing the finishing step
saving coordinates?
I'm looking for the best way...
effort appreciated! 
i did save coordinates but the plotted x and y dont look at all the way the profile is
Try \Create Selection\
if we can nail that down, that would be so cool
Followed by \XY Coordinates...\ (in File>Save As)
i'm getting some bars when plotted :(
followed by create selection, when i click on save coordinates the selection disappears i dont know if thats what is causing problem
did it work for you=?
Well, the numbers look reasonable to me. All the X values are in the 0.35-0.39 range, which matches the data. The Y values range from 0.01 to 0.66, which covers the entire height of the image.
Note that the coordinates correspond to the _boundary_ of that line. Like a fence.
im getting x values (33-38) and y which i guess is the second colomn (0 63)
Yes, they are (X, Y) pairs.
but if u plot x and y u should get the profile right
If all you need is a single coordinate value, you an also use Set Measurements..., turn on \Center of Mass\ and \Centroid\ and then Analyze > Measure.
And you'll have a single center pixel, which might be good enough for your needs?
i need the x and y pairs so that when i plot  x and y together i get what would look like the periphery with the central distortion at center
You can check for yourself: the points are correct.
If you look at the list of points, and then mouse over those points in the image, looking at the pixel probe in the main window status bar, you will see that it corresponds to all the corner points of the yellow boundary selection.
[![plot.png](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/BxsQ/thumb/plot.png)](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/BxsQ/plot.png)
Yep, if you do a naive scatter plot, that's what you get.
I have to run; I think you have what you need. Best of luck with your project.
yes but this is not what i wanted
alright
Your problem is just how to plot the points, then.
[![plot.png](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/bQI3/thumb/plot.png)](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/bQI3/plot.png)
after plotting i wanted something like this
Why don't you just save the image from ImageJ then?
because i need the coordinates not the image
i need the coodinates which if plotted would look like the image above
x and y
do u see?\n
I think you choose the wrong plotter for this
what would be the right way in that case?
You have to set the scale of the axes!
To match the bounds of your image.
ah right and then
Fellas my query still goes unresolved
would appreciate if someone else jumps in the conversation
well how does it look like when you plot the points?
at the moment it looks like
[![plot.png](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/4wOA/thumb/plot.png)](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/4wOA/plot.png)
whereas what i want is simply the mapping of my coordinates such that when i plot the x and y it gives me the contour of the actually image
can you make a screenshot of the data?
yeah just a sec
[![sample.tif](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/FEJE/thumb/sample.tiff)](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/FEJE/sample.tif)
thats the image
ok, i need the extracted datapoints you are plotting
what i need is simply the coordinates of the crack (parabola) at the mid
because i ma quite positive your plot looks wrong because of the scaling of your axis 
how can i send u the data points
which software did you use to do the plot?
excel
you can just drag the file into the chat 
[Book6.xlsx](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/ilcH/Book6.xlsx)
why don't u take the image i shared and see
i am taking a look at it
cool

ok, the points are correct, but exel is definitely not the right tool to plot it. Generally not a good the best idea to plot pixel values with a scatter plot..
if you set the axis to the same scale
you get this result, which is what you wanted :+1: 
glad that works but im afraid i wanted something else,..
ok?
let me put it again: the image i shared before
you see a parbolic crack on one side
i needed the outermost coordinates (x,y) of that crack
look the plot i send you, looks mostly like your picture, its just more zoomed in, and the \pixels\ have space in between.
do you mean like the outline of it?
yup so that would be the left side outline
the outermost points to the left
you need to group your table by the y values
and then take the smallest x value for each y value
and you get the coordinates of the outline
on which software do i do that
i used [KNIME](https://www.knime.org/)  for that, its free, open-source and awesome, but I might be biased  :D  
but i am sure one can do that with exel as well

I can send you my workflow to do it
[extract left border.zip](https://files.gitter.im/imagej/imagej/UUkS/extract-left-border.zip)
```python\n# @OpService ops\n# @net.imagej.Dataset inputData\n# @DisplayService display\n# @UIService ui\n\nfrom net.imagej.ops import Ops\nfrom net.imagej import ImgPlus\nfrom net.imglib2 import FinalDimensions\nfrom net.imglib2.type.logic import BitType\n\n\n# first take a look at the size and type of each dimension\nfor d in range(inputData.numDimensions()):\n\tprint \axis d: type: \+str(inputData.axis(d).type())+\ length: \+str(inputData.dimension(d))\n\n# create the otsu op\notsu=ops.op(Ops.Threshold.Otsu, inputData);\n\n# create memory for the thresholded image\nthresholded=ops.create().img(inputData.getImgPlus(), BitType())\n\n# call slice wise thresholde axis to process, in this case [0,1] means process the \n# first two axes (x and y)\nops.slicewise(thresholded, inputData.getImgPlus(), otsu, [0,1])\n\n# create an ImgPlus using the thresholded img, copy meta data from the input\n#thresholdedPlus=ImgPlus(thresholded, inputData.getImgPlus())\nthresholdedPlus=ImgPlus(thresholded)\n\ndisplay.createDisplay(\thresholded\ thresholdedPlus)\n```
@ctrueden, @hinerm it would be great if you are able to trouble shoot the ImgPlus meta data problem.  The script is above.  
You can try with the confocal-series.tif sample image.   
It's not a show stopper.  The script still functions.  I just can't create a display when creating the new ImgPlus with meta data.
@bnorthan I was able to reproduce. Investigating now.
@bnorthan In case you didn't see, the tutorial scripts all moved to `imagej-scripting`. They will ship with ImageJ very soon.
One thing I was wondering: why do you use `display.createDisplay` instead of `ui.show`?
BTW, I still didn't have time to track down the bug above; will discuss with @hinerm tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow I will be mostly focused on finishing my ImageJ2/Fiji talk.
We also need to do one more round of software releases, though.
I didn't fix the Jython/Windows/headless bug either, but we can use a Groovy script to demo that.
@ctrueden I can change the calls form display.createDisplay to ui.show... I don't remember a specific reason that I started using display.createDisplay, it was probably just the first thing I stumbled on when trying to display an image. 
OK, sounds good.
@bnorthan When you do arrive in Madison?
I get into Madison around 6:00 tonight.  What is your plan for tomorrow??  Do you want to try and run the tutorial by some interns??  I added several image processing examples to the slides.   I may try to simplify them if it looks like they will take more then 30 minutes. 
I'd like us to work on completing the workshop during the morning hours, and then we can run it by @etarena in the afternoon.
alright @bnorthan and @ctrueden . I've been looking more at the otsu thresholding example and figured out what's going on:
Cool.
passing the *original* metadata causes the thresholded `ImgPlus` to be treated as a color image
`BitType` isn't supported in the legacy conversion layer for color `ImgPluses`, so no pixel array is created
resulting in the eventual null pixel array exception
why is it treated as color image? 
because the original image is a color image
and that metadata is copied into the new `ImgPlus`
what means color image?
third dimension = \Channel\?
here's the code: https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/blob/master/src/main/java/net/imglib2/meta/ImgPlus.java#L97-L102
So, to avoid, would it be better to just call `setAxis` in a loop? It feels like there must be a better way...
well it feels like we want an `ImgPlus` constructor that only copies axis information
we use this functionality since ever... thats why I'm asking
right?
but in your case the legacy is involved?
no
it's not a problem in the legacy layer
really, really strange
that's just where the error is eventually hit
Would be nice if the Ops code didn't need the explicit thresholded image creation, and the ops could just return a properly constructed output ImgPlus
the problem is that you are copying all of the metadata about the original `ImgPlus` even when it's not applicable
@ctrueden yes. exactly. OpReducer(s)
but I think we will change ImgPlus and related classes (hopefully) at the hackathon anyway, right?
ImageJ DataModel, RichImg, etc
for this use case we can just add a public `ImgPlus.getCalibratedAxes` method that calls [copyAxes](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/blob/master/src/main/java/net/imglib2/meta/ImgPlus.java#L495)
then call `thresholdedPlus=ImgPlus(thresholded, inputData.getImgPlus().getCalibratedAxes())` 
@dietzc I would like to say we will change them, but not sure there will be time, in reality. We'll see.
@ctrueden what do you think will be eating up our time instead, after we did the API \learnathon\ (just curiosity..)
Ok, [this branch](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/tree/expose-imgplus-axes) is compatible with this script:\n\n```python\n# @OpService ops \n# @net.imagej.Dataset inputData \n# @DisplayService display \n# @UIService ui\n\nfrom net.imagej.ops import Ops\nfrom net.imagej import ImgPlus\nfrom net.imglib2 import FinalDimensions\nfrom net.imglib2.type.logic import BitType\n\n# first take a look at the size and type of each dimension\nfor d in range(inputData.numDimensions()): print \axis d: type: \+str(inputData.axis(d).type())+\ length: \+str(inputData.dimension(d))\n\n# create the otsu op \notsu=ops.op(Ops.Threshold.Otsu, inputData);\n\n# create memory for the thresholded image \nthresholded=ops.create().img(inputData.getImgPlus(), BitType()) \n\n# call slice wise thresholde axis to process, in this case [0,1] means process the \n# first two axes (x and y) \nops.slicewise(thresholded, inputData.getImgPlus(), otsu, [0,1]) \n\n# create an ImgPlus using the thresholded img, copy meta data from the input \nthresholdedPlus=ImgPlus(thresholded, \Thresholded\ inputData.getImgPlus().getAxes()) \n\ndisplay.createDisplay(\thresholded\ thresholdedPlus)\n```
Pending PRs. Features. Blatantly missing ops (of which there are many). Action items which arose from the conference and first hackathon week. Lazy ops. Op reducers. Access to specific op types (esp. functions/computers/hybrids/in-place)  from the OpService\u2014and op reuse in general.
@hinerm So you added `getAxes`? ImgLib2 has worked very hard not to have that.
you have to manually give it a name.. so maybe we should also have nameless `ImgPlus(Img, CalibratedAxis...)`and `AxisType[]` constructors
Well.. that's precisely what the `ImgPlusMetadata` constructor is doing..
@ctrueden copying the axes I mean
the ideal solution would just be a different constructor signature
that says \use the axes from this `ImageMetadata` but nothing else\
er `ImgPlusMetadata`
:worried: I was thinking `ImgPlus(Img, CalibratedSpace)` but since we can't cast in python that won't work..
@hinerm Hmm, how does Jython deal with overloaded methods like that, then?
it just picks the `ImgPlusMetadata`
@ctrueden see [this](http://www.javalobby.org/articles/jython/#overloading). Several jython threads amusingly refer to this as \casting\
So it seems like if your destination type doesn't have a constructor you're out of luck
@ctrueden how does `ImgPlus(Img img, ImgPlusMetadata metadata, boolean axesOnly)` make you feel?
@ctrueden @dietzc @bnorthan - [this commit](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/commit/abb21e0bfd64b92923bc9ae7a8b14a65b3f0fda4) makes `thresholdedPlus=ImgPlus(thresholded, inputData.getImgPlus(), True) ` work... 
sound ok?
@hinerm Looks great, for the short term!
@ctrueden alright, [merged](https://github.com/imagej/imagej-common/commit/f24e7e814ff34481dc1476cd0e450b91da2873e7).
Booooo gitter thinks it knows better than me what the text of my links should be
anyway, anything else need fixing before thursday?
Nope. Just releases.
@dietzc Do you remember who participated in the creation of SciJava at the 2011-Dec Dresden hackathon?
Martin? Barry? Tobias? Pavel? I can't remember.
Ha! I took decent notes! \Participants included Josh, Melissa, Steffi and Tobias\
Martin, Barry, me were also there. 
And some others... Dscho was there for sure. I think Jean Marie,  too.
@dietzc Thanks. I was specifically looking for the people involved in the \SciJava\ discussions then, and I found two lists of people in my notes. It was just for [this slide](http://imagej.github.io/presentations/2015-09-03-imagej2-and-fiji/#/2).
(Pressing space bar a couple of times will reveal it.)
And the following slide shows all the currently active SciJava people.
ah ok great
@bnorthan FYI, I will be at LOCI before 8:00am. If you need a reminder, it's the Animal Sciences building on the west side of campus. The [Lakeshore path route](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Lowell+Center,+Langdon+Street,+Madison,+WI/Animal+Science+Bldg,+1701+Observatory+Dr,+Madison,+WI+53706/@43.0752551,-89.4066025,15z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x8806533587403bc3:0xc12c6225f92b6d1!2m2!1d-89.3954694!2d43.0762073!3m4!1m2!1d-89.3987876!2d43.0765568!3s0x8807acb55224a9b9:0x8129cab3f3ef3ddb!1m5!1m1!1s0x8807acc07e58b3cd:0x344026a2042b1f79!2m2!1d-89.4152427!2d43.0760433!3e2) is a nice way to go!
@bnorthan I'm in now. The front door is open. There's also a rear door (up a short staircase, closest to the parking lot) and if you knock I will probably let you in! ;)
Thanks I'm on my way. See you guys in a few minutes.
@dietzc Quick KNIME question: is it possible to execute a parameterized Jython script in KNIME\u2014i.e., make the module available as a node?
@bnorthan \n```java\nxLen = dataset.dimension(dataset.dimensionIndex(Axes.X));\nyLen = dataset.dimension(dataset.dimensionIndex(Axes.Y));\ncLen = dataset.dimension(dataset.dimensionIndex(Axes.CHANNEL));\n```
```python\nhistogram=ops.image().histogram(logFiltered, 1024)\nprint type(histogram)\n\nthreshold = ops.threshold().otsu([histogram])\nprint type(threshold)\n\nthresholded2 = ops.threshold().apply(logFiltered, threshold)\n```
@bnorthan imagej/imagej-ops#190
@bnorthan not yet. @Squareys is working on this over the next 3 weeks.
then we will have a scripting integration and you can also load jython scripts as nodes.
I meant @ctrueden 
Actually its easy and straightforward to implement. We just didnt do it, yet.
@hinerm, @ctrueden \n\nWhen going through the tutorial I found a bug in the log kernel\n\nWhen making the following call..\n\n```python\nlogKernel=ops.create().kernelLog(inputData.numDimensions(), 3.0);\n```\nIt seems it ends up here\t\n```java\n/** Executes the \kernelLog\ operation on the given arguments. */\n\t@OpMethod(op = net.imagej.ops.create.kernelLog.CreateKernelLog.class)\n\tpublic <T extends ComplexType<T> & NativeType<T>> Img<T> kernelLog(\n\t\tfinal double... sigma)\n```
When I wanted to end up here \n```java\n\t/** Executes the \kernelLog\ operation on the given arguments. */\n\t@OpMethod(op = net.imagej.ops.create.kernelLog.CreateKernelLogSymmetric.class)\n\tpublic\n\t\t<T extends ComplexType<T>> Img<T> kernelLog(final int numDimensions,\n\t\t\tfinal double sigma)\n```
@bnorthan I don't think it's a bug, but probably a type problem
It's especially problematic in jython because of the dynamic types, going to Java varargs when there are potential ambiguities
It's another Jython-ism.
Multiple matching sigs\u2014Jython just picks one.
I think you can solve it by calling `kernelLog(Integer(x), Double(y))`
per http://python.6.x6.nabble.com/Casting-in-Jython-td1778329.html
Oh yeah, for primitives, that is the recommended way.
Might be enough to do just `Integer(x)` and leave `y` as is, even.
yeah as long as there's not another integer... signature?
unless internally all numbers are being converted to doubles by default.. but that could also be a jython implementation detail
oh
it's 3.0
never mind
@ctruden, @hinerm thanks for the info, I updated the scripts again to make the kernelLog call work again,  and tweaked a couple of other things.

the createNewWindow shouldnt be there
is there a stream of the conference talks?
@dietzc  Not a stream. All the videos will be posted afterwards though
@ctrueden I made http://sites.imagej.net/2015-Conference/ and uploaded Wayne's scripts
The IJMs seem to work well... the python and javascript scripts need imports added
it worked OK for python but I couldn't import imagej classes in JavaScript :worried: 
@hinerm great! thanks
woo! Thanks @ctrueden for pointing me to the javascript import fixes
@hinerm Great!
[2015-Conference](http://imagej.net/List_of_update_sites) is now public
hi can anyone help me to count square dots in an optical image
i tried using itcn.jar and brinay-grayscale-analyze particles and grayscale-threshold-analyze particles. but my particles are so close that image J is incorporating the background into its count of particles. 
Can you provide some example images?
@bnorthan  - you think you could add some info in your Ops tutorial scripts regarding which image to open for which tutorial ?? (example : Ops_Threshold_IJ1... make sure to comment in that the user should open the 'c0z12' image)  would be awesome! 
someone wants make a skype/hangout stream for me for florians talk? :-)
@dietzc I tried :( No camera found. Linux fail
so I can say I tried ... and watch soccer ;-)
can someone please point me to the class that has the old 2D binary skeletonize method in the new class structure (assuming it is still around)?
@dietzc Sorry, didn't see this till just now :frowning: 
@kephale is it [this one](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/source/ij/plugin/filter/Binary.java)? That's what I found by opening the command finder in imagej (hotkey: L) and filtering for \skeletonize\
On [GitHub](https://github.com/imagej/ImageJA/blob/master/src/main/java/ij/plugin/filter/Binary.java) as well
@ctrueden no worries. 
@hinerm thats the one i'm talking about, i was just checking the net.imagej.* classes like [this](http://javadoc.imagej.net/ImageJ/net/imagej/plugins/commands/binary/package-summary.html )
which seem to have some of those functions, but not skeletonize
@kephale Skeletonization routines have not yet been ported to ImageJ2 commands.
@ctrueden aha!
cool, thanks!
But they, of course, continue to be available from the ImageJ 1.x UI\u2014which is what launches by default when you download & run IJ2 or Fiji.
Ultimately, we will want to add skeletonization to ImageJ Ops. :smile: 
we have imglib2 code for that
highly unoptimized, but working
oh really? i'm linking to imagej, imglib2, etc via clojure, so an imglib2 solution would be just as pleasant
let me find it for you
@dietzc that would super helpful, i do see one in [knime/knip](https://github.com/knime-ip/knip/blob/master/org.knime.knip.base/src/org/knime/knip/base/nodes/proc/thinning/ThinningOp.java) that uses imglib2
yeah I think this is the one
it's an old Op
we should port it asap
however, I'm not sure if a pruning is already implemented with this op
it doesn't look like it, just pure thinning
maybe a good reason to write your first imagej-op @kephale ? ;p
aiee.. perhaps, i haven't gotten things setup to build locally at the moment, but could give it a shot
sounds great!
@dietzc knime code is fair game for directly duplicating/hacking?
sure you can do ... take it, improve it, make it better, extend it ... whatever you want
I would migrate something like this to imagej-ops anyway sooner or later
from my point of view KNIME Image Processing shouldn't maintain own algorithms & co (thats why we started ops with the imagej guys). we will have one single common algorithm repository which in turn KNIME integrates (=ops)
@ctrueden I hope you don't mind that I just unassigned myself from being an admin of imagej-bugs; I seem to have received a solid dozen spam mails via that mailing list despite being unsubscribed for almost a year...
@dscho No worries at all. It seems spammers are (AFAICT) spoofing the Bounces and Errors-To headers. I am getting a couple of annoying spams due to such bounces on a daily basis. Wish I knew how to stop them, but couldn't find the answer quickly.\nAnyway, you are very welcome to continue being an owner and/or moderator, or not, as you wish on any imagej or fiji related IT resources.
another  ij2 question: how does segment/particle analysis work now? i see net.imagej.measure, but are there usage examples?
Not
@kephale We don't have analyze particles yet in IJ2. Ops is getting close though.
@ctrueden @dietzc aha, yes, there is labeling it seems!
@kephale Lots of data structures are there. Labelings yes. ROIs sort of yes (and more soon). Tons of features, much more than Analyze Particles. But not, specifically, the Analyze Particles workflow... yet.
Maybe we will have it before the end of this hackathon.
hi! I work in a nuclear organization lab and we use FIJI image J to upload ND2 images from our microscope and analyze pixel intensity. Normally, when we open the images in FIJI the image opens as a compilation of all the different Z stacks. Today, only one Z stack is showing. We downloaded the image from gmail. Has anyone else had this problem/could help us with this problem?
@emilyroney Can you post the image somewhere?
@emilyroney Opening an ND2 file uses [Bio-Formats](http://imagej.net/Bio-Formats) to read the data\u2014so you probably see the \Bio-Formats Import Options\ dialog appear?
the file is too big to post here...what should I do? 
And if so: maybe your settings there changed?
@emilyroney One option for sharing big files is https://www.wetransfer.com/
okay trying to share on wetransfer.com what's your email?
@ctrueden 
ctrueden@wisc.edu
@emilyroney BTW We are in the middle of a hackathon (collaborative coding fest) right now, so I may be sluggish to respond. But I am confident that if your data file used to work properly, we can figure out why it doesn't anymore.
It may be a new bug in Bio-Formats, but more likely is a configuration issue.
@ctrueden hey we figured it out! thank you so much!!! 
@emilyroney Oh, great! What was the issue?
@ctrueden it's on the converters branch: https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/blob/converters/src/main/java/org/scijava/convert/CastingConverter.java
Hi all,\nit seems that more and more people end up with broken Fiji installations due to the recent update of imagej-ops/imagej-dperecated.\nhttps://github.com/imagej/imagej-ops/issues/201\nsee also [here](http://imagej.1557.x6.nabble.com/Fiji-won-t-boot-after-update-td5014333.html) and [here](http://fiji.sc/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1159)\nCan someone with upload right maybe fix the dependencies (by adding imagej-deprecated dependency to imagej-ops)? Or otherwise revert the recent commits and upload an imagej-ops including the deprecated code, until the updater gets more robust or the dependencies are fixed otherwise?
Hi All, I am trying to make a video .avi from sequence of tiff images in ImageJ. The problem is the number of images is 24000 and imageJ runs out of memory or something. Can someone guide please.
KNIME could help
knime.imagej.net
anyway, you have to increase your memory
http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5.1/users/imagej/managing-memory.html
@ash0088 And check the \Use virtual stack\ box when opening the data.
You can also try `bfconvert` from the command line.

@hinerm I think the new landing page is a winner... it is MUCH better then ever before!
I am trying to get user input in a jython script \n```python\nimport sys\n\nprint 'input an answer'\ntest=sys.stdin.readline()\n#test=input('answer')\n```
I get IOError: The handle is invalid.   Any tricks to this that I should know about??  Like directing the stream to the right place, or an alternative way??  If it is an issue I can report it.  Thanks. 
Just to be clear I tried 'sys.stdin.readline()' and 'input('...')' and got the same error for both. 
@bnorthan Weird. And Google knows nothing.
You could try Java's way, instead of Python's...
I.e.: use `new BufferedReader(new PrintStreamReader(System.in))` or whatever. Or `Scanner` I guess.
@ctrueden thanks,  but I couldn't get it to work... 
``` python\nfrom java.lang import System\nfrom java.util import Scanner\n\nscan = Scanner(System.in);\ns = scan.next();\n\nprint 'you entered' +s\n```
no error, but it just hangs and I'm not sure which stream it is using.  I can't enter an input in the script editor output pane, or the console.  Anyway not a pressing issue right now.  
Though I'd be interested if any one has a working example of the following use case, user has huge directory of images, wants to loop through, look at them and choose one of multiple options (a,b,c,d).  If a-> do this, save somwhere, if b-> do that, save somewhere else, ...  I'd prefer not to bring up a dialog box.  @tferr or @biovoxxel do you have any examples of this workflow??
Any language is OK
@bnorthan You are working in the Script Editor in ImageJ? I don't even know if it supports harvesting stdin from anywhere...
Maybe that's the problem.
@dscho I was wondering about http://fiji.sc/ops/ and whether you think moving it to https://imagej.github.io/presentations/ would be a good idea.
very nice presentation
didnt know it
or forgot abou tit
@ctrueden go to town
@dietzc I have a present for you! http://forum.imagej.net/
It may be a few hours before emails from the system work as intended, though.
In the meantime, if you are around this afternoon/evening, I can activate you.

this history is clean, just the PR will be a bit ... mixed ;-)
is it ok or do you want me to clean-up?
I answered the question myself
I will clean-up
I can open an PR as soon as CachedOpEnvironment stuff is merged (which depends on pom-imagej).
@dietzc Maybe DNS didn't propagate your way yet. You can use http://144.92.48.175/ for now.
nope
doesnt work

@ctrueden Hello Curtis. \nI started to create a simple ImageJ2 R package (https://github.com/Bio7/RIJ2).  \nWhen I built the examples with maven I got a lot of dependencies. \nIs there a minimum maven example available?\n Actually I need a minimum set of *.jars to include them in the package.\n
\The purpose of this ImageJ forum is to: Centralize questions and discussions regarding ImageJ.\ Because there were too many places for questions and discussions already. Now there is one more. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 
Mailing lists are 19th cenutry ;)
Ok 20th maybr
@dietzc :D yes, maybe... :D
@dscho The idea is to close imagej-devel and fiji-devel, once Discourse gets past a trial period proving it can adequately replace them.
@Bio7 Great news! I will look at your project when I get to the office (on bus now). For minimal Maven deps for ImageJ2, just use \mvn dependency:analyze\ and it will report what can be pruned. The net.imagej:imagej dep is toplevel for convenience; use lower level components to avoid sucking in everything.
@ctrueden\n\nThanks Curtis. At the moment not filled with anything useful. But as you can see here in the IJ1 example:\n\nhttps://github.com/Bio7/RIJ1/blob/master/RIJ1/R/RIJ1.R\n\n I think it should be easy to fill it with something useful for R users.\n\n
@ ctrueden \n*.jars location is here: \nhttps://github.com/Bio7/RIJ2/tree/master/RIJ2/inst/java \nand will be loaded when the package is loaded.
@dietzc so you define the mailing lists to be obsolete. My, my, I think you are in for a surprise.
(You are not the first, and definitely not the last, person to declare mailing lists dead. It would surprise me if you were the first to be correct in your assessment, though. I'll just chalk it up to wishful thinking.)
ok. there have been examples where technological advance was beneficial for everyone. fire, wheel, airplanes, github... ;-)
and as far as I understand the mailing lists will not be shut down... lets see how the forum works and how well its used
then we can judge. 
@dietzc As I said above: I want to close imagej-devel and fiji-devel, if the Discourse works out well. Obviously the main ImageJ list will continue no matter what.
absolutely makes sense
sorry for the duplicate, wanted to reach more of you :-) some thought on the development part of the imagej.net page are on the very nice new forum if you are interested ;-). appreciate any comments or actually the extension of the topic as a help for finally helping in structuring the page. here's the link: http://forum.imagej.net/t/structuring-ij-developer-wiki/28
@biovoxxel Yeah, I saw the forum post. Thanks for that. I'll try to respond as I have time. Hopping on a bike at the moment...
@kephale FYI, I activated both of your forum accounts. You created them _just_ before the issues with email were sorted out.
Hi all, just monkey-patched ImageJ 1.x in CellProfiler here: https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler/blob/issues/1561/java/src/main/java/ij/plugin/JavaScriptEvaluator.java#L42 . It's the Java 8 / Nashorn issue. Should I ask Wayne to change? Wayne if you're here, what do you think?
@LeeKamentsky I invited @rasband to join just now.
@LeeKamentsky Note that we did the same patch to the scripting-javascript component: https://github.com/scijava/scripting-javascript/commit/167d606b8ef18e502b8f16a530eccd2c55c5cf12
My understanding of ImageJ 1.x's strategy for dealing with JavaScript in Java 8 is that it downloads (on demand) the old Rhino interpreter as an add-on JAR.
See https://github.com/imagej/imagej-legacy/issues/119
@ctrueden is anything beyond the jogl-3dviewer discussion on github (for the hharrison fork) happening with 3d viewer? the java8 issue keeps biting me
err and one other thing, it seems as though maven artifact IDs that start with a number do not work with all maven-friendly programs
Thanks @ctruden - there's a reason behind the similarity of my Nashorn patch to yours - I stole it.
@kephale Regarding the Java 3D work, I really want to do it (https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues/120), but I don't have time. Unfortunately, there is too much on my plate for the next 1-2 months. We will need to do it as part of the migration to Java 8 and a new launcher, which is slated for later this fall.
@kephale About artifactIDs which start with numbers: which \maven-friendly\ programs do not like them?
the clojure package manager Leiningen
Of course.
Might want to report it as a bug to the Leiningen team then?
good point, fixing it in leiningen wouldn't be too bad
We could rename the 3D Viewer package (and 3D Objects Counter and 3D Blob Segmentation) I suppose.
It would make them consistent with their Maven properties in pom-fiji, which would be nice.
i didnt see anything about it in the maven naming conventions
Feel free to file an issue in fiji/fiji if you think we should do it.
Heh, fire drill here, gotta go. BBIAB
but i haven't seen any other maven artifacts that start with numbers
@ctrueden Java3D: down to the details of using a Shade plugin?
i'm certainly surprised by the amount of coding that you can fit in, just trying to figure out the current state of affairs with the 3d viewer
@kephale Actually, I wasn't planning on shading it, initially. I know we discussed it, and it might be nice to do that, but for the moment things work without that.
The shading might avoid issues with people who have OS X setups that have gone through several OS updates, and still have the old Java 3D libraries in /System/Library/Extensions
The hold-up is just that I have to revise my Maven branch of the hharrison fork to be built on latest master. It has tons of conflicts right now thanks to the fact that I moved everything around.
I should redo it to: A) be based on the newer jogl 2.3; B) not move around any classes, but instead use POM hacks to split up resources and sources in the same src folder (I have done this before, for Bio-Formats, and it works); and C) migrate the repo to the scijava org, since it seems like the hharrison fork will not adopt Maven any time soon.
In other words: get things set up to maintain this fork long-term, in as shallow a way as possible, so that I can rebase over upstream's latest master whenever we want without pain.
Although, for what its worth, those libraries don't change frequently 
Yeah, but it was a week's work to do it the first time. I can't put in another week of work to redo it every time a new JOGL is released...
I should have written/saved a shell script that did my actions the first time I did it...
oh no, i'm just figuring out what is needed to get it up and running
i can take a pass at merging those, its useful enough for me
@kephale https://github.com/fiji/fiji/issues/129
@LeeKamentsky FYI: http://forum.imagej.net/t/python-scripting/80/2
Thx curtis - replied there. Hope he takes it forward.
@ctrueden  hey thanks for the changes in the Bc template. I guess the arrow signs would otherwise have not been consistent over different systems (?)
@biovoxxel No problem! There was some issue with excessive whitespace so I felt the need to meddle. While at it, I wanted to use `{{arrow}}` internally to make the code more [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). I think it is great now. I love the change to black arrows.
@LeeKamentsky Thank you very much for replying to that thread!
@LeeKamentsky I added a blurb to our wiki which links back to that forum thread: http://imagej.net/Jython_Scripting#Some_limitations_of_jython
@ctrueden on 3d viewer: i went through the diffs with the hharrison repos and your maven branch and you don't have any signficant conflicts, unless they are seeping in through build.xml v. pom.xml. everything builds just fine (something is a little weird with the 3d viewer javadoc creation, in that it doesnt work for me), though i'm having issues testing the rebuilt 3d viewer as I'm doing awful things like manually moving jars around
hey, is there someone who can help me get started with developing with imagej?
Hi @mhatch0307, did you have a look at our wiki yet? http://imagej.net/Develop should give you an overview, it also has links to a few tutorials.
Feel free to always ask questions here and on the forums http://forum.imagej.net
ij2 question, are there plans for image registration code? i'm thinking about turboreg in particular, which would be nice to open up for exposing some of the internal functions (doing that locally, but it would be nice to have in the main jar)
@hinerm Can you check out this page and let me know what you think? http://imagej.net/2015-10-01_-_ImageJ_conference_presentation_videos_are_posted
@ctrueden looks good to me
@ctrueden looks very good!
I suppose the videos were recorded and post-processed by my best man?
@dscho Indeed.
@ctrueden great!
I will announce it to ij-conf-2015 and imagej and twitter and G+ and on the forum in a few minutes.
@kephale Sorry to ignore your question. The current plan for registration is to start tackling it using imglib2-realtransform as a base, starting in spring 2016. Specifically, we want to revamp the IJ2 image data structures to support multiple images  coregistered via transforms.

@gab1one Actively hacking on that.
@ctrueden top, I worried something was broken without you knowing
@gab1one All should be working now. Let me know if you see any further glitches.
And all announcements have been sent out regarding the presentations. Back to normal life.
@ctrueden cool, good to know. then i wont invest much into these hacky registration codes i've cobbled together from existing plugins
I just got SimpleElastix running with ImgLib2
I will play with that for registration
until the new \dataset\ of ImageJ2 is available and people start adopting their registration algorithms to use it
@dietzc ooo that sounds awesome
oh thats via the jython interface?
afaik there exist a lot of point/feature based registration methods in the ImgLib2/ImageJ2 universe (e.g. the stuff in the multiview-reconstruction), but nearly nothing intensity based
and the new imagej-itk bindings?
@kephale nope via JNI bindings
but I don't use any python (?).
I just built SimpleElastix https://github.com/kaspermarstal/SimpleElastix
oh ok cool, i was just checking out the examples and they're all python, but presumably thats just because its the easy way to get to ITK
and replaced the (in my case) libSimpleITKJava.so file
and  the .jar
ooo, that doesn't even sound painful
and tataaaa it works ... but this was like 25minutes ago, so I didnt have the time to test it excessively
building SimpleElastix took over 1.5h
alright, i'll try it and test it out a bit over the weekend
anyway! Let me know if you run into problems!
What kind of reg do you want to perform?
will do, thanks!
affine
intensity based?
yeah... there is nothing really there in imglib2 yet
there is one simple example
http://fly.mpi-cbg.de/~pietzsch/advanced-imglib2.zip
there, inside the zip, there is a \Alignment\ implemented in ImgLib2 using gradient decent
you can check it out, maybe this already helps you
and then there is turbo-reg from the EPFL Lausanne. But this is tightly coupled to FIJI itself ... afaik @fjug hacked a bit on it and made it \headless\?
thats all i know :-)
i'll check that out too, it would be appealing to just use the libraries that are already linked in
@dietzc I have literally no idea what you're doing but it sounds interesting! :octopus: 
is it anything worth putting on [the wiki](http://imagej.net/ITK)..? :D
actually its even too easy for that
there exists an extension for SimpleITK called SimpleElastix which is (from what I understand) SimpleITK + SimpleElastix ;-)
I just built this project, replaced the native libraries and the corresponding jar with the java files
and thats it
Welcome everyone, I officially announce this chat room opened!
I will publicize this with our next release, for the moment this is not yet documented on the Website
thank you for the great piece of generator
Nice ! I asked about the mailing list because I think more people could ask more questions, share some thoughts, help each other... Twitter is too restrictive, github issues too formal and I've seen people losing credibility on stackoverflow because of nothing. But I got your point, this might be helpful enough. Thanks
Next version should be out soon, mostly with minor corrections in the Heroku sub-generator
Awesome
I am building an app using Jhipster and I wish composite keys were supported as part of the Cassandra generation
hey guys, does anybody have an idea to reduce the switches further in this [PR](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/1496)
[PR](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/1496)
i'have create a jhisper app. It work on spring-boot, but when i put the generate war in tomcat 7,  i have this error java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.servlet.ServletContext.getVirtualServerName()Ljava/lang/String;
Looks like a wrong version of the Java EE APIs
We use servlet 3
But reading http://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html it should be OK
Can you give me your Java version and Tomcat version?
tomcat 7.0.62
java 1.7.0_51
That should be OK then
good news :)
Same issue here with Grails: https://jira.grails.org/browse/GRAILS-12105
I would say it is a packaging problem, how did you build your WAR?
OK, found the solution: http://www.concretepage.com/forum/thread?qid=291
So this was added with Servlet 3.1, and you need Tomcat 8 to run it. I don't know why we depend on it, we should work OK on Tomcat 7 as far as I know
effectively, i've removed tomcat-embed-core-8.0.20.jar, etc. libs and it work now...
on tomcat 8, my war works too :)
OK, if you can deploy on Tomcat 8 that's perfect
on my laptop yes, on our test server with jenkins, it require a bit work...
Spring boot as it is works with tomcat 7 without any issues
yes it should work with Tomcat 7, I don't know the exact setup of @flecoq but there might be something else that forces him to use Tomcat 8... Anyway hipsters should use the latest version :-)
Hello everyone from Tampa Florida :)  We are beginning a new project with JHipster and I was curious to know what some of your favorite tools are for developing with JHipster?  Which IDEs, editors, SCM clients etc.. do you use in your daily workflow?  We started with Eclipse but have since migrated to IntelliJ. The gradle support in Eclipse seemed incomplete and was changing the project structure so that our CI build (Jenkins) was breaking.
 I'm using Maven but IntelliJ is perfect for JHipster. No specific issue encountered appart from the fact that you need to exclude some directories from the project to prevent IntelliJ search in file to look into NodeJS files and bower files. I'm also always having a shell aside running grunt server. SourceTree of my favorite SCM but that's not JHipster related. 
Thanks for the tip about the directory exclusions for IntelliJ Henri.  I've been using the \show grunt tasks\ in IntelliJ along with the Gradle window to execute bootRun and serve from the IDE.  So far so good...
Thanks @henri-tremblay for tip, I wasn't doing it! Maybe we should have a page on how to set up Intellij and Eclipse, or generate the right config files like mentioned in https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/1446
BTW I'm using Intellij & SourceTree too. And some command-line, with oh-my-zsh.
And Atom, but that's mainly for coding the generator, so I don't think this is relevant for you
Hello all, I love the idea of jhipster, and have played with it a bit, but I have some concerns about it and would like to hear your opinions of them:
I'm using fish and oh-my-fish but indeed it's not really related :smile: And Sublime. Wasn't really happy with Atom
First up, I don't like the monolithic nature of the thing generated in one big fat directory and would prefer seperate projects. I could split it up post generation, but then I couldn't use the workflow to add more tables/relationships/etc easily. So I thought maybe it'd be possible to have a few directories in a tree. Something like generator top level where the yeoman stuff is stored, and subdirs for db access, front end, split away from each other and able to be worked on independently and released independently with different life cycles.
The top level setup could retain knowledge of what went where for future updates/additions.
Thoughts?
The other concerns I had were around stability and security of custom auth impls, but you've made a LOT of commits since I last played, so it's probably improved and certainly deserves a retest before critique.
Obviously the monolithic style should be retained as default. However it'd be really nice if it supported a split out layout.
Just realised it's sleepy time in France! And Spain, where my wife is. So, buenas noches a todos! :-)
OK, got the latest fired up here, metrics work java -jar target/*.war on my local amd64 Ubuntu box, but not on my server with the same war in i386
I experienced this before, on the last one 2.1.1 that I tried, no error or anything, no nothing, no response to the menu click.
Not working is OK for whatever reason, but some feedback would be good.
I recall being able to get it into a confused state where other menus also wouldn't work, but not the details, and my memory may be wrong.
Server is Wheezy with JDK8 from Jessie backports and a few bridge packages from Jessie.
Ha! Solved. Adblock plus was killing it. :-D Wish I'd realised that last time. Looks neat :-)
@fredcooke Yes, adblock blocks scripts containing anything with metrics. See #1434 for details.
hey guys. just a question. how hard would be to pivot jhipster to a microservice generator with an optional UI ?
Hi everybody, @vionita what your are asking for is \Spring boot\ i think
@padewitte , kindoff. and I'm more interested in the infrastructure needed to integrate the services and especially the authentication and authorization part (oauth ?) 
Does anybody got a clue how to simply add a custom angular route quickly ? I tried to use angular-fullstack generator but it seams that JHispter is using the same structure but not the plugin.
Do you tried to install angular-fullstack yeoman generator for your jhipster project?
Normally generators are not compatible with each other, but we made some effort to support the \angular\ generator, so maybe the \angular-fullstack\ also work, but I didn't test this
I just give a try to angular-fullstack but you can not just add a route without creationg a full application and this is not the qucik, clean, easy solution i want :) Will try angular.
so, you have to create the full application before you are able to use the subgenerators?! 
Good morning @jdubois , any thoughts on my modular project generator idea/request?
yes, with angular too it is not  directly working. 
@fredcooke the whole idea is too have everything in one project, but yes you are correct -> that's one of main points we need to work on, but I wouldn't put it that way
I'd like to use the whole Netflix stack to have more \micro services\ with JHispter (now that's hipster!)
Like being able to have 2 JHipster front end apps that can connect to a JHipster back end app
In REST, of course
So we could separate JHipster apps in modules
Well, for example, it'd be nice if all of the JPA annotated classes lived together in a db-model maven project, and that was depended upon by layers above, and so on. So more than just service + front end.
I'd also strongly like to move the war packaging into its own project such that packaging concerns are separated from functional concerns.
Good to hear you're at least partially open to it, anyway :-)
for the monolithic fans, you could just add a multimodule parent pom into the mix, and for the modularists, an aggregator only.
in any case, i love what you've done, it gives me a single-handed chance at doing a full fledged web app for my project 
we talk about different things I'm afraid
you only want one project, but seperated into several Maven modules?
I want different projects, talking together by REST
to me, they're projects/artifacts in and of their own right
yes, understood
for example, the jpa stuff, once nailed, won't change frequently, it has a life cycle with potentially few releases
and it's nice to depend on the released artifact and solely develop and build the things that depend on that, above
I hate multi-project modules with Maven, but I'm not doing JHipster only for myself, that's why we have different options in the generator :-)
i hate them, too
i keep the modules separate and build them and release them as required.
another idea I had in this area, would be to package and release some of your code as libraries that jhipster projects simply pulled in from mvn central
yes that's often asked also
I'm just not doing it because it would complicate my release process, but that would probably be a good idea as it would reduce what we generate
on the other hand, people won't be able to tweak what has been generated
exactly, and you could more easily say that a particular artifact was stable.
my idea is that Spring Boot is the lib, and we only add tweaks on top of it, so people should be able to change them
well, i suppose that's true, however they could always grab the source repo for that module and rerelease their internal fork etc
so it's a bit complicated to know what should be put in a lib, and what should be generated
yes you are correct
I guess I'll have to have a closer look at what stuff is included to see if they are tweaks or not :-)
I like the ideea of having multiple jshipster apps talking to each other via REST. maybe also by some messaging system?
not a big fan of maven modules especially created based on application layers
@vionita yes we would use the whole Netflix stack for this. This would be a huge work, probably that would be our 3.0 release
Hi guys I have some entities which work fine in dev mode but after the grunt compression some of them fail. Which is the best place to start to fix this.
Normally that shouldn't happen, depends on what you call \fail\
If you have an issue with the Grunt compression, that would be a ticket for them
I can see the rest resources request, the html file, which are all the same in the target folder but the table is not rendered. And clicking the create button just opens up the dialog with missing buttons.
@fredcooke wonders what the \whole netflix stack\ is
Thanks I'll try to debug this on JS level to see what is happening.
Can't say i was expecting that to be so in-your-face, sorry.
@jdubois @fredcooke I'm also interested in what netflix stack means and how would work with jhipster. some pointers would be good. maybe we can help with such a migration to microservices
vionita, re the maven modules, imagine that the jhipster UI wasn't the only thing hitting the database, nice to release those packages separately so they can be used separately in other components. etc etc. 
There are probably better things out there, but here's the doc about Spring Cloud Netflix: http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/spring-cloud-netflix.html
I'll stick with jhipster 2.X, thanks :-) Cheers for the link, though.
I want to change the templates of jhipster to get my own layout (e.g. for routing, tables and so on). What would be the best way? simply editing the package in node_modules or should I clone jhipster and then do a npm link?
I would fork the project, and maybe give it another name, and do npm link
Perfect! I was thinking the same thing, just getting through my dinner before commenting :-)
I will give it a try
@jdubois @fredcooke Spring Cloud Netflix - got my head spinning 
@jdubois the netflix stack is awesome. We've used only some parts of it yet (hystrix, archeus) but ir really rocks! So jhipster build on spring boot netflix would be awesome!
Hello, I wonder why directory  bower_components/ isn't mentioned in .gitignore file so that i won't be versioned?
@turuum It's required to start a jhipster project right away after cloning it from a git repository
won't it repopulate itself though?
only when explicitly invoking the command to do so.
mvn package doesn't take care of it, then?
as far as i have in mind no-
Maybe I'm wrong but if you call spring-boot:run -> then yo plugin is also start -> then bower install is also called.
it's a shame that all of these front end parts aren't pulled in as dependencies too, are you guys aware of the webjars project? somewhat in contradiction of the hipster movement, but... :-)
Yes but at least I don't like webjars that much compared to bower and the nice frontend tooling provided by grunt
I'd be more OK with it if the raw materials were stored in ~/.something and just used during the build to assemble something working.
Checking other people's artifacts into SCM is so 1995, and not very hipster at all.
That's the best way to use Bower, have a look at their docs. Ignore it if you want, you will see that some libs do upgrade and use the same version number, and you will get unreproductable builds. They are just tags on Github, people move them around sometimes.
thats a lot of components http://netflix.github.io/#repo
btw @jdubois did you find time to review that PR for making i18n optional?
@deepu105 not yet
I posted an issue previously which looked like a compression error. Finally no grunt errors just an invalid html tag (<textarea/> is invalid ) and (<textarea></textarea> is valid)
OK, but where does this textarea tag comes from?
My own fault, I changed an input  field into textarea.
A more general question I have, if there are any plugin concepts available in jhipster. What we are looking  for is to disable/enable a set of features just by dropping some jars from the project structure, or coordinate different build targets in a way that different features are released and others are excluded per target. Resulting in different feature set over all layers, web (navigation, forms), service and data. Just disabling it by roles doesn't help since we have different bundles of the application and these need to be handled per customer. Any hints are welcome.
You could use Spring profiles for this kind of thing, but what you want to do looks really complicated
Thought of profile already, thanks. Simply said the feature I am looking for is how to merge two or many jhipster apps by configuration. At the moment we are just branching per customer, which works fine but requires some manual work. Otherwise we are quite happy with the stack. 
I don't have a good solution here... Yes I guess branching is also a good solution, perhaps even better. Then you need to have some good process to build everything.
JHipster 2.12.0 is under way!!!
There will be a link to this chat room in the home page, so we should have even more people participating in the talk
:+1:  Impressive you can keep the nearly weekly release cycle!
@atomfrede it's very easy to release with NPM, I just have to do a \npm publish\ :-)
 Yup NPM rocks :) especially if u use a grunt/gulp plugin that does the major, minor auto bump and git commit, tag and npm update everything in one step is so neat, you should consider using those as well for your own workflows
Yes it's a bit manual as I need to update the samples project. But that's not a lot command, and everything is done in less than 1 minute
Btw have you tried the npm test recently? 
now, but I believe it works as we have Travis running
let me check
Does that work, i was getting some weird exceptions
yes same issue, it works but throws weird errors
so this needs to be corrected, I'll add a ticket
Hmmm so it is not my fault :smile: 
I thought i screwed up something 
Anyway bedtime good night hipsters :)
good night!
Does anyone have some experience with testing directives with external templates in JHipster? I'm trying to run a minimal test, but for some reason get the following error during the test: Error: Unexpected request: GET api/account?cacheBuster=1432308693294
hey, just wanted to say thanks to whoever put the new IDE configuration pages up - that was quick!
hey btw for eclipse should we exclude scripts folder? what if we want to work with html and js within Eclipse, they do have angular plugin and stuff
hey guys anyone facing issues running gatling on windows with gradle?
13:54:11.483 [ERROR] [org.gradle.BuildExceptionReporter] Caused by: java.io.IOException: CreateProcess error=206, The filename or extension is too long\n
I get this error
saw a similar bug on gradle forums but that one seems old and fixed
https://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-2167
ill try reducing entries in my classpath
no use, still same error. Damn windows!! the classpath added by gradle is too long with all those generated cache folder names. saw this post so wondering if there could be some config to make gatling work on windows with gradle
https://discuss.gradle.org/t/filename-too-long-in-windows/9222
any gradle experts to the rescue plz
Hey, porting jHipster to MS SQL, and writing a guide along the way. Sadly slightly stuck, anyone thinks they can figure out how to fix this error? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30410653/jhipster-ms-sql-and-liquibase-throwing-java-lang-nosuchmethoderror
@deepu105 I have my windows machine at the office and have a short vacation until wednesday. So I can't check it, but I've never tried it on windows
@atomfrede plz let me know if you are able to test, im not in any hurry :wink: 
@deepu105 this is the crappiest thing, but usually applicable in game installation and the like. Try making your project directory C:\\1charletter\\*
like just
C:\\a\\src etc..
that can help a lot
but yeah that character limit for filepaths can be horrible.
Either way, tell me your settings for `yo jhipster` I'm running on a windows machine, so I can try to replicate.
@Zyst see #1514 i think
will check it out @atomfrede \n
Thanks guys
could replicate with 2.4
@deepu105 and @atomfrede on issue #1514 
@atomfrede  is it possible do the manifest file approach for the gradlerun task?
i have posted that on the issue?
im very new to gradle so dont know how to do that to override for gatlingrun task, if you could give me a pointer I can try that out and if successful can do a PR
Hi guys, I'm from unixstickers, do you have an SVG version of your logo? cc @atomfrede 
@pennadl Yes, of course: https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io/blob/master/images/logo-jhipster.svg
@pennadl All images can be found in the website repository: https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io/tree/master/images
@pennadl If you would like to have an svg with jhipster text underneath just write me a message, i've already create one
@deepu105 the `gatlingrun` task is just a plain `javaexec`so if it is possible with that type of task yes.
@deepu105 I've found some hints not forking a seperate jvm process might overcome the error on windows
@pennadl Can't wait to place another order at unixstickers, just waiting for the jhipster stickers :smile: 
@pennadl yes stickers will be great!! Thank you @atomfrede !
@Zyst have you seen our \tips\ folder in the website? We collecting a few tips before we make them public
We should also have a page for Oracle, so it should match the MS SQL Server page, probably
Ill be porting to oracle 12c sometime next week, if anyone has done that already it would be nice if you could share some tips. Else ill share a tip file once i do that successfully 
@jdubois will check it out
also @deepu105 I'm writting a guide with my experiences porting to a Winserver DB, will likely be applicable to Oracle
also @jdubois cannot find the tips folder. https://puu.sh/hYhuG/68251809f3.jpg 
@Zyst he hasnt merged the pull request for tips folder yet,  he is waiting to accumulate some tips beforw publishing, so just as in below thread 
https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io/pulls
yep that's where I'm hanging out in
you can do similar to this
gonna find the Oracle one
oracle one is not yet in
>We should also have a page for Oracle, so it should match the MS SQL Server page, probably
ya we should have :wink2: 
gonna hopefully find a way to make it work with MS SQL by myself, you can prob. grab that as a reference to port to Oracle, if an Oracle one does not exist.
but not yet i guess, this one I found for oracle https://cirovladimir.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/jhipster-using-oracle-database/
thats for oracle 11, but I guess for 12 it will be slightly different 
@deepu105 I love you to death
Ic an finish this with this
thank you mate
yeah I did most of that
didn't add the driver and a few other things but I'll figure it out
also did you check out the SO answer for your question? I'm thinking maybe you can patch it directly on your backend, maybe.
@Zyst  your last comment is it to me?
yep
about the gattling issue
oh ok almost forgot that :wink2: 
I really like jHipster, the community behind it seems fun. I'm gonna try to stick around and contribute.
meee tooooooo
i really like the concept of writing code that writes your code :joy_cat: 
haha, all in all (Hipster thing and all) I'm really glad I found this, I use Angular in basically everything I do that has anything to do with Front end design
and I used Java for backend (Although so far I usually used JSF)
so I'm glad I found this solution, it's making my life so much better.
it reminds me of this article on LISP http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html
ha ha  ya, I would love to see a day when your applications are fully autogenerated from a base model
well this is as close as you get so far, like honestly this builds so much of the backend it's pretty awesome.
never touched LISP, I really should
right now I'm married to the Java, Javascript, Scala cult
I also wanted to learn C# but I keep feeling like if I diversify even more at this point I'll just spread myself too thin knowledge wise and end up being a Jack of all trades, master of none.
ya exactly, I feel the same now, I have touched so many things that now i'm not an expert on anything :sob: 
haha, how long have you been doing this for a living? 
I only started around 1 year and a half ago, to do this professionally that is. But I messed with coding all throughout my teenage years.
5+ years :sob: 
was originally an electrical engineer :joy: 
ah cool, yeah I used to be very open source-ish in my teenage years
now I've become a full enterprise tool
ha ha I'm evangelizing Jhipster within my  organization :joy: 
Hello, I can't run jhipster app locally after deploying to Heroku... I get an Exception at com.mycompany.myapp.Application.main(Application.java:72) Caused by: org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.EmbeddedServletContainerException: Unable to start embedded Tomcat ...  Specific - I am using postgress and compass... please help.
did you see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30408669/jhipster-cant-run-local-dev-profile-after-deploying-app-to-heroku ?
Are you on the 2.12.0 version?
@jdubois Hey I'm on the homestretch with Liquibase, configuring it with SQL Server. I know you have no particular interest in this, but can you look over this question? I promise I'll add a guide on the tips section of the site outlining how to modify jHipster to run SQL server, I already have it written except for this last step that is just killing me:\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/30421427/liquibase-nosuchmethoderror-with-sql-server\n\nEverything is default, except for the application-dev.yml that has been modified to use the JDBC (The connections do seem successful)\n\nThis error seems to be caused by the 0000*_initial_schema.xml or the (default) DatabaseConfigurations.java
Would really greatly appreciate you taking a look.
@jdubois Yes, I am using 2.12.0 version, I have post my consol log there in this question as: Michal, what am I doing wrong?
Hi - is atmosphere support in jhipster?
Hi guys! jhipster is very interesting. Nice approach.  I have a question about supporting SpringJDBC in future versions ?
Another question: after starting the application I didn't see \nice\ styled web page like in tutorial posted here http://jhipster.github.io/video_tutorial.html. Is it a bug depends on compass libraries ? 
yes, fixed: sudo gem install compass --pre
When I deleted HerokuDatabaseConfiguration.java and Procfile then I can again run my app in dev mode...
Hey guys I havent really dont any enterprise web apps of any kind so i'm just a little confused with something simple. How do I link what is in my java code with the html?
For instance if I make a variable that has the number 3 how can I display that?
It looks as though just Spring's Websocket support is included - but it appears that atmosphere did have some support at some point.   Please correct me if I'm wrong.
If I'm right, why was atmosphere dropped?
From what I know, Atmosphere was dropped because it wasn't behaving correctly with Spring Boot and also Swagger. Not really Atmosphere's fault. It's just that the mix wasn't good. Things have now improved and Atmosphere is still awesome so it might get back from what I understood
@henri-tremblay Thanks for the answer!
@jdubois can you please take a look at https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/1469#issuecomment-104982180
I am building project on MAC, it required XCode. Why must need Xcode (>4GB) ?
^ I am pretty sure this is not even valid english syntax.
But if I am guessing correctly, which I guess I am not because your question could mean a shittload of other things:
This project doesn't require XCode
This project can use any text editor (or technically, to run the basic install) no text editor at all
other than the libraries required for running yo jhipster
which are node, yo, and jhipster
which are, all in all, around 15 MB total at most.
guys I'm gonna ask a very stupid question, when we run in prod profile,  how do we enable the content to be served from dist by default?
I know its done by StaticResourcesProductionFilter
but do we have to  manually key in the/dist path?
im using gulp and dist folder doesnt have index.html
i guess something went wrong
let me check
anybody using gulp and seeing the same issue?
sorry gulp+gradle
could you please elaborate? What you said confused the heck out of me
as far as I knows our profiles are \Dev Production and Fast\
in jHipster
yes 
I was trying to run a default app in prod profile
it was a gradle + gulp build
and when i did a gradlew bootrun -Pprod it wasnt working
then i found the dist folder is missing index.html
so now trying to run same using grunt + gradle
ok its working with grunt
@Zyst in my problem, it thrown error when command ran to \npm install\. You can see same issue here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27665426/trying-to-install-bcrypt-into-node-project-node-set-up-issues
alright have you raised an issue?
I can try to replicate
also
give me some settings
yup plz try
yeah just
paste the settings you used
so I can see if I can replicate
```\n{\n  \generator-jhipster\: {\n    \baseName\: \jhipster\\n    \packageName\: \com.mycompany.myapp\\n    \packageFolder\: \com/mycompany/myapp\\n    \authenticationType\: \session\\n    \hibernateCache\: \ehcache\\n    \clusteredHttpSession\: \no\\n    \websocket\: \spring-websocket\\n    \databaseType\: \sql\\n    \devDatabaseType\: \h2Memory\\n    \prodDatabaseType\: \mysql\\n    \searchEngine\: \no\\n    \useCompass\: true,\n    \buildTool\: \gradle\\n    \frontendBuilder\: \gulp\\n    \javaVersion\: \8\\n    \rememberMeKey\: \205e93fe54c501a2b7d9be13e56e65c8dd694211\\n  }\n}\n```
awesome
also
my config
@trongtran npm install definitely is something with your system
I have run npm install with the default countless times and can confirm it works
gonna replicate @deep105
ok
i tried again with no compass option but no index.html again
https://puu.sh/i0TSc/00a7d2dce4.png does this look right? 
yup
kk sec
dunno why you use gradle @deepu105 , must be some kind of masochist hahaha
but anyway gonna try to run prod and see if it works
from gradle
i come from an ant background :P
so gradle felt more at home
Still would recommend trying Maven, build times are like 50 times faster, honestly would never use Gradle for anything other than Android.
wasnt doing server side for long time so maven was new to me as well so went with gradle :P
fair enough
ya should give it a try
but unlike gradle i have to install maven locally rite?
depends on your IDE
btw you can try to replicate with maven as well
IntelliJ has a Maven build preinstalled afaik
nah maven works
know that for a fact
oh ok i use intellij
okay got default
giving it a min or so to parse stuff and running it
but its a gulp thing rite so if it works with maven it should work with gradle as well
have you tried maven + gulp?
I haven't actually, anyway let me run the Gradle one first
and see if it's a platform thing
but have to admit gradle initial run is slow as hell, but subsequent ones are fast
oh ya windows :worried: 
Maven inital is fast and Subsequent is lightning fast
oh ya windows :worried: 
should really try it unless you have a hardcore grudge against XML
which I could understand lol
i guess will give it a try for next project
yeah still running installation
i was under the impression that gradle was more hip :P
it is lol
i actually liked the simplicity of gradle when compared to an ant build or a pom file
its way less code
pom feels more simple to me, but I've been using pom for ~1 year so it kinda makes sense.
and easy to read :joy:  but when i see pom files i go nuts 
oh dude, pom can go fucking berserk
i really hate XML :P
I've seen 1k+ line poms
but as far as you are good so is your pom
seems to be the norm for most things
I bet shitty programmers can fuck up gradle as well
alright seems to be done
i did a spring+drools integration and used maven (though it was generated by eclipse) and when finished i had three pom files with each having 150+ lines
which command did you need me to run to replicate your issue
and reading through was very tough
I'm very used to reading XML
because I'm in Financial programming and my country uses XML as a standard
run grunt build and see if there is index.html in the dist folder under webapp
so it's kinda become a second language to me
aren't you doing this with gulp?
ya even i'm used to xmlbut dont like it :P have been doing lots of soap services earlier so i got tired of xml
anyway I have no grunt because you said to use gulp
oops do gulp build
http://puu.sh/i0Uqp/4c9b783089.png
i guess just run `gulp build` fromcommand line
its a gulp task so no need to run fromgradle
don't have gulp on my command line, always use grunt
ya but now since you have generated this app it will install gulp locally for you when you do npm install on the folder
yeah absolutely, grunt build still going weirdly enough
npm install would have been done already by yo:jhipster if you had let it run fully
I'll report back in a couple of minutes I guess
`yo jhipster` doesn't do -g installs as far as I know
for npm
ya but does locall install and since its a dependency i guess it will be installed
atleast local to that folder if not global
you can't call a local install from command line\u3000\u30fd(\u00b4\u30fc\uff40)\u30ce 
unless you are balls deep in the node_modules folder
doesn't matter
ha ha ya. so is your gulp failing now?
it's just not doing anything
gulp is supposed to run after the main run
are you doing that?
Running the main that runs on 8080
and then running gulp
but if its not runnable it should throw error
no error so far
just stuck
gonna install gulp give me a sec
gulp build is called from gradlew bootrun -Pprod as well
what command do you need me to test specifically
actuallygulp is faster than grunt
just gulp build?
yup
coz the dist folder items are generated by gulp usemin if imnot wrong
http://puu.sh/i0UH5/97b65302df.png ah shit gotta add Compass and Ruby
oh you didnt have compass
not in my Path at least
ok can you regenerate the app after changing useCompass to false
installing both give me a sec
nah just using both dw
no need to install
it has same issue without compass as well
http://puu.sh/i0UKy/8415cc654f.png using chocolatey
installing is literally faster than re-running gradle
gradle is super slow
i guess need not run gradle agin
just run gulp build
yeah running that
http://puu.sh/i0UUZ/da05268389.png
ran properly it seems
which folder did you wanna confirm?
src/main/webapp/dist
there should be an index.html there
http://puu.sh/i0UYG/825a1023b6.png no index.html for me
so its a bug i guess
are you sure you don't need to run the application.java first? Note that this is a 100% clean install
no this file should be generated by gulp
not sure if its a windows issue
any way will open an issue first, lets see 
Does seem to be an issue https://puu.sh/i0V9c/519a27d23a.png
can't serve from gulp
@zyst can you check with maven as well?
sure thing
trying with Maven, same settings as before.
have opened https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/1530
saw it
trying with maven
but yeah, Gradle seems sketchy as fuck, specially with Windows.
thanks bro
All in all I would never recommend it for an Enterprise project haha
Like I tried to use Spring boot + JSF for an Enterprise project
and I just gave up half way, I'm now 100% I'm the best person in my country for troubleshooting super bizarre and specific spring boot stuff.
he he, do they still use JSF, i would prefer deprecated JSP with taglibs to JSF
But it got me nothing
duuuude
JSF is good
don't diss the JSF
I'll drop the Balus on you
I never tried JSF :P
It's so easy, it's just insane
like it feels like you are cheating
then again if you are a full stack you _have_ to use xhtml so that's the biggest downside you can get
like seriously
screw xhtml, forever
everything breaks with xhtml
but someone did a JSF project in my company and it was screwed up,might be the people didnt know it well enough
you want a
#NAME?
works on maven
ran tests on Maven
kinda _works_ on Maven upon further review
you mean works with gulp and maven?
mvn -Pprod spring-boot:run
did you run this?
After initializing my project with jhipster, when my collegue pull it, he's facing a table already exists with liquibase. What is wrong ?
the table already exists
no
but i'm under ubuntu and my collegue windows. So we configure windows/mysql to be case insensitive but the problem still exists !
if mysql tells you the table already exists, I'm pretty sure it's correct
I'm sure because I drope them manually. We found a work around by deletting all changelog files and only keep add ones. It works like that
I guess that was error from liquibase when you try to generate an entity with same name again. Did you manually delete an entity and generate it again?
Hi.. I just started evaluating jhipster and relatively new to Yeoman. I am planning to use Oracle database. What is the best way to go about it? Generator doesn't support Oracle yet, so is there a way to skip the database part?
you can generate with mysql or posgres first and then tweak to work with oracle
we are working on some guide/tip to do the tweaks so you can refer that later to do for your app
@deepu105 @jdubois @Zyst : when my collegue pull the project (containing my liquibase changelogs) he's facing a \table already exists\ problem. In his DB scheeme there was no table : th scheeme was created just for this purpose.
the issue is resolved by deleting all \changelogs\ files and keeping only \add entity\ ones !
Hello, I am looking for a doc how to deploy jhipster on Amazon Web Services. Someone already try it ?
I've had feedback from people doing it, but I didn't see any blog post or article about it
I have deployed successfully to EBS, but never tried with prod profile, as my deployments were prototypes I normally will install generated war with dev profile, But it should work pretty much the same with prod profile as well
websocket doesnt work though
will try with prod profile and do a tip file when i have some time
In the mean timeif you have any question let me know i will try to help
Hey @jdubois , do we have any documentation for removing Liquibase from the project? Or just remove the Maven dependencies and hit run until I get no more errors?
For context: Fortunate enough to have a dedicated DB person this project, so I'll just go ahead and create all the entities with the jHipster tool so I do get the awesome code generation, then manually map the @Table and other Hibernate variables.
No, but it's easy -> remove it from the DatabaseConfiguration class (there's a specific Spring bean which runs it)
just remove the `public SpringLiquibase liquibase(DataSource dataSource)` and good to go?
yes, or just remove the Spring annotation, or use a specific Spring profile
alright, thanks. 
That makes the app crash, just gonna go ahead and write a guide as I do this.
it shouldn't
that's how the \fast\ profile works
gonna re-add it and see if the fast profile by itself works, might be something on my side.
good news I finally got SQL Server working
if you have time you can submit a tip here: https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io/pulls
alright fortunately I basically documented everything
yeah will do 
I planned on doing so 
so just normal .md files work for you?
yes
alright I'll submit in a bit
in retrospective
it really isn't that hard it just has a lot of weird ass details you gotta nail otherwise it'll just fail.
yes that's why it's good to have it documented
I can't test it as I don't have SQL Server
we should send an email to Microsoft
they tend to donate a shitton of licenses for open source projects
like if it were something that interests you
I'm fairly sure they'd give you a license
yes it interests me, but I'm really not sure they will
and anyway I'm on a Mac
So I will need some Windows license for VirtualBox too
added the tip
https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io/pull/56/files
I'm reading it! Thanks!
I'll add the \tips\ page soon
glad to know no one will have to go through this suffering
cost me 50 rep but well worth it
Does anyone has comments on the new DTO implementation with MapStruct?
I'll probably do a release soon, with the DTO marked as \beta\ so everyone can start playing with them
what actually changes with the DTOs?
like, rather is there some place to see the examples?
you can use them if you want!
but it changes a lot of stuff in the templates
I would need to make a new repo for the samples
not sure if I'll do this, it's quite a lot of work, and it would be temporary as I won't be able to maintain everything
let me think of this!!!
I'm gonna stave off an update until I see what actually changed haha. Since I just started a new project with this version and telling everyone \Hey! Please re-clone we're using the cutting edge instead\ would probably get me no small amount of hate.
Yes, I'll put this feature in BETA anyway, so hopefully it won't break too many things
for future reference how do you install jhipster betas?
just reinstall and you are auto in the beta?
It's explained here: https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
you need to clone the repo and do a \npm link\
it's surprisingly easy in fact
alright will try to install it in a VM or something
to check for differences
actually I'm gonna get drunk and will do that tomorrow, today was a long day haha
@jdubois please keep me updated on the feedback with the SQL Server tip, it's pretty sketchy, it does work but it's plain weird.
might be able to make it better
with some reviews
anyway saw the tips n' tricks section, good stuff.
Tips and tricks look awesome
but shouldnt it be in main menu after help and bugs?
or can be under help and bugs as well I guess
but documentation doesnt seem the correct place, coz documentation otherwise talks about using what is bundled in the generator and tips and tricks is about using external plugins and stuff rite
@jdubois plz reconsider!
also I guess we can reduce your work of manualy updating by putting in  a piece of writeup on tips guideline so that we can ask users to do submit files like `xxx_tips_heading_seperated_by_underscore` and then we can automate the tips index page to include all files in the tip folder in the order of submission with the file name as header after trimming `xxx_tips_` and humanizing, similar to what ypu have done for release notes. what say?
Hi, I got an architecture question: \nJHipster seems like a perfect answer to me to use a JS frontend with trad. Java backend
but I'm starting a project with a team that came up with the idea of JS Front + Node.js -->REST>-- Java backend (can be traced roughly to [http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/10/07/node-js-and-the-new-web-front-end/]())
this is confusing to me. I can see why frontend would like to have it's own server stack, but to me the whole architecture seem to be a recipe for problems 
I figured some of you would be familiar enough with Java AND Nodejs and tell me whether they've seen that  structure already and the pro/cons. 
And maybe just if this was or just wasn't considered for JHipster
I have seen that structure before, but those are for projects where you build a front end that is physically deployed seperateley and use an existing REST API
For  a new project with REST api specifically for that projects front end I dont think its worth having a front end server with node
yes, that's their idea. 
I suspect this would create many problems
how does the frontend communicate with the backend in a JHipster default config?
I dont know if it will create problem but it would take more effort and is more complex
in JH everything via REST API calls
and with angular your UI logic is already on the client side and your backend does no UI logic at all
right
so is the backend completely stateless in this configuration?
You can choose a oauth option have it stateless
ok, I was looking at the possibilities on Jhipster create an app page. I guess if an intermediate NodeJS server is used their is no question, the backend has to be stateless.
Though there might be a way to manage session through a REST API but that would at least partially defeat the point of using a NOdeJS layer I guess.
@deepu105 yes I need to find a better place in the menu for the tips section
Any documentation pointer regarding Oauth vs Token authentication?
http://jhipster.github.io/security.html
Hi!\nI'm trying to deploy the generated warfile but I get a WARNING: Unable to load class [my.package.ApplicationWebXml] to check against the @HandlesTypes annotation of one or more ServletContentInitializers. error , same for ApplicationWebXML and for LoggingAspect. I get the same errors for both the \basic\ and the .original warfile that was generated. Any tips to solve this?
Are you deploying from the default configuration?
also how are you trying to deploy the generated warfile
try to use the one that is not the .original
use the other one
go to your command line
and type
java -jar mywarfile.war
on the proper folder
I'm trying to deploy i through a tomcat  webapp manager
I tried deployin both the .original and the other not .original
same errors
you got the same errors running java -jar mywarfile.war ?
give me a sec i'll try to run it from command line
I got Exception in thread \main\ java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: my/package/Application : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0
got this from running java -jar app.war and not the original
which version of Java are you using, and which java version did you select while creating the app.
like
your JDK I mean by that.
I chose java 8
might be that the server has java 7
hm, I'll check the server
please do
Yes that's a JDK version error
jupp, server got 1.7
damn :/
yep, update to 1.8 or remake your package with the Java 7 option
not sure which one of those is faster :)
I'd just update if you have access to the server, no real reason not to.
don't think I can persuade the server admins to upgrade
then downgrade.
unless your app has some real work done in it
yeah, that will be the solution I think, not sure about the time needed to downgrade the whole project
then grab a pitchfork and go lynch your server admin
they are in a different country :/
\u30fd(\u00b4\u30fc\uff40)\u30ce give in to despair 
I'll contact them, maybe they have some magic solution for this, I don't think I'm the only one who uses java 8
thanks for the help!
a really really really _really_ hacky thing I would absolutely not recommend you could do is just packaging your JDK in a .zip file or something, unpacking in your server and running your server directly from the /bin folder
like
just a really bad practice thing
but hey if it's the only choice
to avoid losing a ton of work
that assuming you have remote access to the server
which I assume you do because you can apparently run terminal/command line commands.
yeah, deploying on a remote server from shell, but I have limited privileges
bloody shame, best of luck @nezuvian 
shame indeed, you don't even wanna know how much burocratic hassle it took just to get this, it took two months to get to this point :)
thanks again @Zyst 
as a protip if you want to swing management your way say \Yeah we used a lot of features from the new Java 8 version, a lot of our codebase has Lambdas, use the new Date Java 8 feature and the like. Regenerating everything at this point would take insane amounts of time! Or you could convince our server overlords to run one single command to update Java and everything would work!\
That's how I'd approach it.
Is it possible to upgrade the SDK for a single user on linux? I'm not much of a sysadmin
yep it's possible, but it requires some degree of sysadmin skill.
something like this: http://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/how-to-install-check-java-version-in-linux/
That's not a problem, we got a whole sysadmin team, I'm sure they can solve this then.
Thanks again!
Well then, once more, best of luck. Hang in there @nezuvian 
No prob.
again if they don't budge
nevermind
hi
I'm having the following problem in my .pom file\nPlugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: com.github.trecloux: yeoman-maven-plugin: 0.4: build (execution: Run-grunt, phase: generate-resources)
hi I am using HTTP Session and users. How can I  allow a 3rd party application to access the spring rest apis in this case?
can i combine http session authentication with token based for api calls
why not just use token based in general?
The project was generated with http and I don't know at which point i could simply switch them
is this security configuration?
found it Thanks Zyst
I hardly did anything, enjoy!
guys anyone have an idea about oracle 12c? i mean have anyone used 12c?
im exploring the possibility of using the json data support introduced
so that along with relational data we can store json and query, join based on them as well
no experience with Oracle 12c but (you shared this one) https://cirovladimir.wordpress.com/2015/05/07/jhipster-using-oracle-database/ here's documentation for using jhipster with Oracle
and I also have under the tips n' tricks section one for Win Serv.
no no im not talking about JH integration of oracle, that one im doing side by side
this was a generic question to see if anyone had tried using json with 12c
https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ADXDB/json.htm#ADXDB6251
well, best of luck man, no clue about the json support
check this, seemslike lot of possibilities
i mean it can be used to model a hybrid SQL + NoSQL database
you are so hipster bro 
lol
only thing I'm sad about is the lack of a binary option of databases
usually a byte[] in Java
use it for a load of stuff
Passwords, Files and the like
because apparently storing files in winserv is considered good practice go figure.
looking at the generated code for the first time right now... just wanted to say: you guys really rock~~
never seen such a complete, clean maven config
Just a little bit afraid of the Spring boot magic. Everthing's hidden I fear it's going to take me some time to find all the controls I'll be needing
Haha it will
:worried: I'll be rolling up my sleeves 
enjoy, I've truly fallen in love with the framework
suspect you might as well
i'm already falling in... !
Just too bad the team I work with insists on introducing a nodejs UI server layer...
It's going to make everything more complex, I'll to find ways to configure deployment for 2 servers...pfh
sounds painful
good luck
Just check the size of jhipster app: \node_modules\ folder has 373M. Does anyone know why it is massive size for just front end JS ?
blame node~
seriously though you shouldn't be pushing that to your repo anyway
yep but it is still massive size in terms of deployment.
you shouldn't be using it for deployment either
what the hell are you doing
@jdubois  the new documentation structure looks neat :+1: 
btw i wrote key replacers for translate thingy, so way lesser switches now 
now we can replace page titles and placeholder from english json files and generate the output  so no need of switches in most places :smile: 
will submit the 2nd PR today or tomorrow
Yes I get your idea, I think it should work out well
@jdubois  done have submitted a PR
Hi,  I have generated an entity json file with name accountType.json. When I ran the application it has generated the table with name \accounttype\. How to generate table name as \account_type\ \ (each word separated by underscore). I tried changing the json file name to account_type.json. This time it has created the table with name \account_type\ as expected  but the domain class name has been generated as \Account_type.java\. Can someone help me to generate table name as account_type and domain class name as AccountType.java. 
You can of course change it manually
But I thought it would create a \account_type\ like you want
I will check this and correct it
Thank you Julien Dubois. I will try changing them manually for time being.
it was generating with underscores. unless someone changed it
@jdubois I also noticed that in latest build the entity field and relationship question has a default Yes, did you change that?
I don't think I changed it
There was just one change
The relationship had an upper case at beginning, which was wrong, so now it's a lower case
but it's a different matter
or was it like that fromthe beginning :confused: 
It's not generating underscores anymore :-(
And sorry, this has always been the case
No idea why @prasanthrc is the first one to notice it, it's quite annoying!!
hi there, I am trying to generate a template project with : yo jhipster, but I get #_ is deprecated. Require your own version of Lodash or underscore.string what's wrong ?
I am on mac
Which version are you using?
Welcome to the JHipster Generator v2.14.0
I have the same issue in dev
Oh, and how did you install it?
It doesn't exists yet :-)
By following the installation instruction on the web page
Can you show me where?
Install Yeoman: npm install -g yo\nInstall Bower: npm install -g bower\nDepending on your preferences, install either Grunt (recommended) with npm install -g grunt-cli or Gulp.js with npm install -g gulp.\nInstall JHipster: npm install -g generator-jhipster\n
https://jhipster.github.io/installation.html
And this installed you version 2.14.0???
well I guess ;)
oops
yes
big error somewhere
let me have a look ASAP
gracias
merci ;)
@drakoh can you do a \npm update -g generator-jhipster\ and try again?
you should get v2.14.1
which should work
for the room purposes : yes version 2.14.1 is working
Hi @jdubois, reg. the underscore issue it was there from last few versions. Actually I am trying to revamp an existing application which is having 130 tables. I have also written a Java program which will auto generate JSON files from existing database.  While I was testing  the generated JSON files, I tried to find a work around to fix this underscore issue. It lead me to brought the issue to your notice.
@jdubois  is there a way to enhance the default user entity with few more fields like say country.
krishna I'm actually gonna try to do that in these few following days
automatically as far as I know there is no way to do that
but I will document how I do it and submit it as a tip
i open ticket  #1528 but it was closed because it was solved. I've been testing and still not working. Does anyone know the solution?
It could not be replicated
so it's not an issue.
As several OneToMany do the same entity?
I'm sorry, I really cannot understand what you are dsaying. Best of luck man.
help me @jdubois on issue #1528 
ha ha ha 2.14.0 @jdubois were you drunk?
btw underscore in table!!! i guess since the JH_ tables had undescores i was assuming everything had it, never checked the generated table names :cry:  
and most of my entities were nouns
so never doubted that
Atlast got jhipster work with oracle 12 c
liquibase generated JH_USER tabel with password field alone in lowercase i dont know why?
and damn the oracle 30 char restriction :angry:  most of the constraint names generated by JH will have more than 30 for relationships
its gonna be lot of manual work to use oracle with JH :worried:  
Hi, I have created issue #1549 
@deepu105 this is a bad... Maybe we could generate some other names for the constraints? Maybe just for Oracle?
@jdubois Can we add oracle as an option in DB? I have already done all of the config for my app, and its working. just need to add some logic to generate names less than 30 char and put it in the templates. I can do a PR if needed
We can ask the user to put the ojdbc jar in approot/lib if they select oracle 
That would be cool, if you can write slight documentation as to what you changed and in what order
I can also add SQL Server
as another PR
SQL server just works completely
out of the box after a few modifications
no real changes needed
to the app structure
SQL Server also seems to have an alternative open source driver
not using it though, it's not the official MS one and my company would hang me by the balls if I did
but I could try to implement the stuff using the open source one
so there would be no need for the /lib thingy
for SQL Server
@Zyst I've used the OSS driver years ago, and it was supposed to be better, but I don't remember why :-)
@deepu105 @Zyst the problem with including them is that they are not OSS, so I can't test them. It's complicated to support something you can't test... So at the moment I'd rather have some documentation pages.
eh fair enough
@jdubois I dont know about sql server but oracle you can use personal edition for testing without a licence 
And im not sure that oracle will be easy to use just wit a document coz you have to take care of 30 char naming restrictions and then the sequence for id column this you have to do for every entity. It will be lot of hassle to do it by hand. Since im using  a customised jhipster for my project, which i have tweaked to use angular bootstrap fully instead of bootstrap, with translation optional and few other tweaks, i guess im gonna add in oracle so that my team doesnt have to go through the hassle
 Yeah it might be worthwhile to check it out. However I also understand the no OSS being an issue
So either way is fine. @deepu105 you should consider submitting as a
A tip for adapting oracle
Sorry writing from phone
@Zyst  I can submit a tip, but a tip asking you to modify every liquibase changelog by hand defeats the purpose of using liquibase to an extend in the first place
So you just ditched liquibase?
nope im anyway customizing JH to work with oracle and i ask my team to work with the JH local version i provide so it works for me'
they will do a NPM link to the JH package i give
so my team doesnt have to do any manual work as i would customize the JH package as needed
so far I have made i18n optional, since my projects doesnt require them as of now, i can enable if required later. Also have changed to angular bootstrap hence changed how all the modal dialogs are used also changed components like progressbar, datetime pickers etc  
now i need to add in the oracle part as well
that is why i bug jdubois so much with feature request and PRs :joy_cat:  coz i would be doing them anyway for my team so i can easily do PR here as well :smile: 
currently exploring feasibility of doing an AWS stub generator similar to the heroku/CF ones. It seems to be doable with AWS CLI or AWS node SDK so if people are interested I can contribute that as well, but i will take some time for that a i have more pressing things to finish first
Aws sounds good!
But yeah work comes first
Yes, it's good to have AWS generator.
@Zyst @deepu105 OK let's put it in the generator then, but as I can't test them we need to put some warning sign... If people are ready to pay $$$ to Oracle and Microsoft, they can also send me some of that money so I can test JHipster on those databases...
Ha ha my client has a weird policy, if the application is in category critical they give only oracle else mysql 
My original proposal was mysql ofcourse 
Oops NDA
Oracle is not so hard to setup, i guess it should be easier in mac. I hv it setup in my laptop, we need to pay license fee only if we are gonna use it for production so for dev and testing its free
So anyways i hv no choice but to do oracle so once im done ill share the repo or a PR, you can take a look and then decide if you want to merge it
Any suggestion on what approch to use to limit names to 30 char?  I guess we cant just trim it off at 30
oh yes @deepu105 if there is a free dev licence on Mac, I can have a look at Oracle, but I'm afraid it's going to put all kind of weird stuff on my Box -> I'll have a look if there is an official Docker image, it would be the best solution
for the 30 chars it can be a shorter version of what we currently generate
or even some random name
but something meaningful would be better
Ya that's for sure, in windows it created a seperate windows user and took up 4gb of my ram initially,  oracle is weird
hi, I'm new to this, just installed jhipster-generator today
after building a maven project and importing it into Idea, Idea can't build the project
mvn spring-boot:run works fine
but building in Idea gives me this error: Error:java: Annotation processor 'org.mapstruct.ap.MappingProcessor' not found
mvn spring-boot:run works ok except it seems there is no hot-loading of Java application code - I see old references to instructions on setting this up but I don't see those instructions presently, should it just work?
example I'm editing the log.debug message in a Resource file and do not see the changes unless reload
I guess hot reloading was removed.
It can still \work\ but it's deprecated, because there were lots of issues, and Spring Loaded is not in active anymore.  Doesn't work on Java 8, for instance.
For IDEA this is because of MapStruct, but that shouldn't give an error -> did you configure anything special? Annotation processing should be \off\ by default
Hi, yes annotation processing was on and disabling it fixed it. I don't know why it was on if its off by default
thanks
thats a shame about hot reloading
although its always the UI that is the most fiddlesome, and reloading that does work
Hi, i don't know if here is the best place to ask for... but could you have a look in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30404042/jhipster-running-application-inside-a-context-image-and-glyphicons-problems#\nIs it a bug?\nI'm passing throght it
work with contexts from the same project seems a big challenge
@jdubois  the master branch `package.json` still shows \version\: \2.13.1\
@iuricmp does it work in dev profile?
i saw the link, not sure if its a cssmin issue or a config issue
ill try to replicate this when i have some time, can you pass the jhipster config you used?
@deepu105  works fine in dev profile
how can I pass it?
@deepu105 \nhttps://gist.github.com/iuricmp/bb7f96a8ae6e6678cd75\nhttps://gist.github.com/iuricmp/160dd880fb72262ca663
@deepu105 yes I need to work in a \maintenance branch\ -> I normally don't do it, the \master\ is what is being released, but the migration to Yeoman 1.0 is much much more complicated than I expected
oh Ok :) I thought it was wrongly updated :)
@iuricmp not this config, the .yo-rc file which contains what options you selected. btw the gist contains your rememberme key, you shouldnt be sharing that. any way ill take a look
@iuricmp yes im able to reproduce your issue with prod mode and tomcat context\\
i guess you can open an issue for this
for timebeing you can manually update the generated css files like this replace /bower_components with ../../bower_components and /assets with ../../assets
Hello, i'm new here... I installed jhipster with yo and tried to run it but i'm getting this error:  org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: type \datetime\ does not exist
anybody has an idea why?
@jdubois  small suggest : generated code for User entity should have isXXX for getter methods like \isActivated\ and not \getActivated\. It will be more compatible with tools like lombok
@deepu105  it works! thanks
Hello, I'm a newbie for jhipster. since jhipster version \Release 2.14.2\ after generate entities class it will have DateUtils in angularjs service but it don't generate class in utils package. how I get DateUtils source code? \nMany thank!!
Everyone how likes to get a jhipster logo as a sticker should upvote the sticker at the official unixstickers trello board (even latex and haskell have more votes!!) https://trello.com/c/SvGHos3d
How do you vote?  Is it available only to certain geography?  I couldn't find an option to vote 
Hey @deepu105 or @jdubois , either of you have any insight as to how to send a file from the frontend to the backend?
I have that requirement as well, but havent started yet. Was considering angular flow plugin for that. May be you can check that out as well
Ng-flow
And u can use this spring io guide for  backend https://spring.io/guides/gs/uploading-files/
You can checkout blueimp as well if you like, though i liked ng flow
thanks @deepu105 I'll check it out
will probably write a tip if it's not trivial
It shouldn't be trivial i guess, i have done it b4 and used to work out well, just didn't try with JH stack, but that shouldn't matter
@deepu105 I think you have to be logged in to upvote certain stickers (and need to have a trello account)
@Zyst I've also used blueimp in the past, works very well, and that was with something very close to JHipster. Might be forth a \tip\!
If anybody is good at Yeoman here, I need help with this last issue so we can be ready for Yeoman 1.0: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30592237/preparing-for-yeoman-1-0-this-installdependencies-not-working-anymore
@Zyst  I've integrated an ng-flow compliant endpoint and service into a JHipster application before.  It was mostly straight forward except for the GET vs. POST chunk HTTP code which I'm still not understanding completely. 
I'll look into it
Anyways, I can push up a sample later tonight.  Just let me know where you want me to push it to.
if you can do that then anywhere is fine, really.
like, github, dropbox, mediafire, megaupload I don't care man
it'd be a massive help to have the example.
ok, i'll just create example Jhipster app with an upload file feature.
and let you know where it is when i'm done
Websockets - I can not find any information how this works in JHipster application
@RagnarFrunck general documentation is fucked, just look around until you find it.
@danielshiplett @Zyst push it on github somewhere. I'm not familiar with the jhipster generator, but I can help on the java and angular side
@Zyst OK.  Have a basic example up.  https://github.com/danielshiplett/jhipster_uploader
I will be offline for a bit.  Will be back online in about six hours if you have any questions.
@Zyst no problem.  it'll be nice if this makes it into the baseline.  i've had to implement this in several apps.
yeah having a way to have file upload natively would be great
@danielshiplett just checked out the entirety of your upload 
that's like pretty insane
in a good way
@Zyst thanks. my two suggestions for it to make it better before it gets into JHipster are. 1 make the local upload location/chunk directory configurable. 2 break the final storage mechanism out of the uploader code so it is easier for people to replace where they want to ultimately keep the files (i.e. S3, CDN, etc.)
then really to make it a complete solution we'd have to figure out a good mechanism for allowing the end client to download the files again (if needed).  so sort of a download service that is analogous to the uploader service.
@danielshiplett @Zyst yes that would be awesome!!
@danielshiplett right now I'm working on making a 'simpler' solution using the blue imp uploader. Like sometimes you don't want to store the file at all for example, just need to do something with it. That's what I'm working on right now.
Rather in my solution we'll also store the file eventually but not necessarily at the time of upload
so I'll just work on something simpler that allows you to get the file from the frontend to the backend, then you can do whatever you want to do with it.
@danielshiplett great work man! I just started a project that relies on user uploaded content, so this will surely come in handy...
Hey @jdubois quick Quality of life suggestion for the entity generator:\n\nhttps://puu.sh/ial4t/2b3446b57e.png\n\nMake clear which one is meant to be the 'owner', is it 'Hero' in this case? Or is it 'Person'? For instance. \n\n(Also, quickly generating some code to give a small course to my company! They freaking love jHipster)\n\nAnyway, thought it might be worth noting.
ha ha I had the confusion as well initially, then figured out it is in your case hero
ofcourse by trial and error, hence it would be nice if the question was `Is Hero entity the owner of the relationship?`
I agree that the documentation for relationships needs a revamp, its very confusing at the moment
I need help from someone using grunt for front end
I notice that everytime i run grunt build the concurrent task takes atleast 20 seconds, so i tried the tasks in concurrent in sequence like normal (without piping concurrent) and noticed its much much faster, even if compass task is present
so need to see if its just me or if everyone else see the same, in that case why cant we remove concurrent and have those tasks run the normal way
[![blob](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/rtUB/thumb/blob.png)](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/rtUB/blob)
this was ran on a newly generated app
which command do you want run?
`grunt build` right?
ya
this is after removing concurrent
[![blob](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/2vCG/thumb/blob.png)](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/2vCG/blob)
@Zyst  did you try?
@Zyst @deepu105 you are correct, I'm going to do a specific documentation page for relationships
@deepu105 yes the current build is slow, I didn't test without the \concurrent\ -> it was there by default and it looked logical that it would be faster
@deepu105 if you can test again and maybe provide a PR?
BTW the current move to Yeoman 0.20.1 is very big, lots of tests to do -> I won't merge the other PR at the moment, this is just too much for one release
ya OK, it can wait. let me know if you need any help to rebase with latest version you have when you decide to merge
about the concurrent task, if someone else can also confirm I will push a PR, coz i wanna make sure its not a platform specific behaviour
org.mapstruct.ap.MappingProcessor  
@deepu105 this processor not in  mapstruct-processor-jdk1.8 
@Zyst @piedrahitac yeah, at the time i started the work, i needed a way to reliably upload very large files (1+GB OVAs). the chunking, pause, resume features of ng-flow along with the angular directive made it the easy/obvious choice.  blueimp seemed like the kitchen sink and i didn't really need any of the media preview features.
folks, I read in http://jhipster.github.io/using_dtos.html, that mapstruct does not work with java 7. I can't seem to confirm that, can you please confirm for me. I need to have java 7 out here. TIA!
ok, confirmed that http://mapstruct.org/news/2015/03/05/arrays-configuration-inheritance-mapstruct-1_0_0_Beta4.html --> supports all the way to java 8; kindly update above link for accuracy
Hi all out there,\na question about how to run tests on a jhipster project using mvn. I can't find the right command :(\naccording to the wiki page http://jhipster.github.io/running_tests.html \mvn clean test\ is for running integration tests. but what am trying to do is running all tests stuff.
@abessifi `mvn clean test` for running Integration tests should work. There's also the gattling tests https://puu.sh/iaTJ1/e90099c484.png and a lot of other options. \n\nAs far as I know there isn't a specific command that will run integration tests and then do Gattling.
@deepu105 a default `grunt build` http://puu.sh/iaU5r/a6e9c384f1.png
@jackrabb1t yes MapStruct supports Java 7, but we don't support Java 7 and MapStruct on JHipster. This is because we use lambdas on those structures. Sure, we could port it to Java 7, but we don't do any work on Java 7, it costs time and as this is already EOL'd we have better things to do.
As a random commentary, I've worked with some 12 Java developers and you are the first person I've ever seen that uses Lambdas @jdubois not complaining, I'm really glad people are using it.
Also the Optional, I use a lot of Scala so glad other people are embracing that kind of stuff.
it's Java 8, we need to move on!
yeah, my two team members were flabbergasted when they saw the Lambdas, I made them read the Oracle learning path for Java 8
@Zyst you are on windows as well rite?  It would be nice if some one can test on mac or linux, 15 to 20 sec for dist task is  annoying, so is the npmInstall and bowerInstall checks on the builds, the frontend build takes more time than backend, i had some gulp builds which were lot faster with more tasks, i dont understand why it takes more time to load the tasks here
oh dude the npm install and bower install
takes freaking ages
like seriously insane amounts of time
my backend is assembled in around 4-8 seconds flat
I can be patient for first time but for each prod build it checks again and thats annoying so i have disabled those as i would know if those aren't installed when i hit an error anyway :wicked
Btw Zyst i tried maven on JH, the first time setup is lot faster than gradle but subsequent runs are almost the same. And really the pom is extremely long, it cant beat the simplicity of gradle and the ease of customization 
I really prefer the pom by far
but that's just because that's what I'm really familiar with
don't blame you for not using it
As some one new to both i would prefer gradle its so simple to understand like reading a java or js file
And so easy to hack
Btw i need an opinion from guys here
I need to do some batch processing, and want to reuse the business layer in a JH app, so planning to integrate spring batch into the app and trigger it using spring scheduler
Planning a integration/batch folder in src and have batch stuff there
Anyone see any downside for this approach,  is there a better way to do this? 
@deepu105 I will run the grunt tasks sequentially on Linux in a couple hours and post the results...
Is the test project supposed to have compass enabled or not?
>I notice that everytime i run grunt build the concurrent task takes atleast 20 seconds, so i tried the tasks in concurrent in sequence like normal (without piping concurrent) and noticed its much much faster, even if compass task is present
is the quote
so probably compass is irrelevant
prob would be better to test without compass though @piedrahitac 
[![before.png](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/olda/thumb/before.png)](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/olda/before.png)
that one is the `grunt build`of a freshly created project with all the default options and the concurrent task...
[![after.png](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/vI1k/thumb/after.png)](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/vI1k/after.png)
and that's the one without the concurrent task (that is `imagemin`and `svgmin`executing sequentially in the build task)...
the difference isn't as dramatic, but still significant...
BrowserSync isn't automatically synching the browser after modifying the sass file - 'grunt serve' is running, I'm on port 3000, there is no error in the javascript console, any idea where I should start looking to diagnose this problem?
have you tried with other browsers?
@Zyst Yes - it doesn't work in either Chrome or FF
base setup?
No - I've been working on the code base for awhile - but I've only just tried using the BrowserSync functionality
But AFAIK, I haven't made any modification to the BrowserSynch/Grunt functionality
try a clean installation (in another directory) and see if it works to diagnose whether it's your machine or something you changed
@Zyst Hmmmm..... a clean install doesn't work either
Doing a reload from the browser picks up the changes - so the css is being generated and I can see grunt acknowleding the new css

@statefulj it's probably definitely something on your side
unless the newest version broke something
can confirm it's working properly on my project
can't update to latest yet though because I have no idea of what the mapstruct change would do to my project
Does anyone use JHipster with JRebel for hot reload classes ? It failed to work in JHipster app, but other apps works fine in STS IDE
@piedrahitac can you try with compass on as well? 
btw @deepu105 are you getting on the Win10 hypetrain?
Not yet man wanted to try it but no time to spend on that
Anyway not a great fan of windows either,  using windows just bcoz i hate mac more than this
On windows 8 and sucks big time
Win 7 seemed better
@Zyst btw which timezone are u in? 
Central US
UTC-06:00
I think that's Central US anyway
I actually do like Windows
I (heh) experimented with Linux in my teenage years
for some good 6 years or so
and seriously being in Windows is so painless
Still do a lot of stuff with Linux, hell all of my VPS instances are running some or another Linux distribution
but I really like Windows all in all
also I also do SAP ABAP programming
and SAP is basically impossible with Linux and horrible with OS X
so Windows it is
@deepu105 Sure, I will try with compass enabled tomorrow, I'm on UTC -05:00, so I will do it past noon...
@JHipster devs: Does anyone use JHipster with JRebel for hot reload classes ? It failed to work in JHipster app, but other apps works fine in STS IDE
@Zyst u seem to online at my timezone 
Im at +8 utc
my schedule is pretty messedup
and I have a home office
and my main hobby is being at my computer
so end up being here a lot
Hi there, is there any intention of supporting/generating Angular controllers, services, etc. as ES6 classes and transpiling using traceur/babel (either in the browser, or compiling to ES5 as part of the Grunt build) ?
Hi. Is it possible to deploy two jhipster applications on one Tomcat server? Accessing the two applications concurrently is not possible. I can only access one application at the same time. What can I do to solve this issue?
@yyred you can generate war and deploy in tomcat webapp folder if you have a tomcat server
if your war files are named different you can access both with the name as context path
Hi @jdubois How about generating ESAPI property file and Utility classes as part of securing web application  from common security vulnerabilities?\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI_Swingset
@deepu105 thank you for your answer. There is an issue using same login 'names',e.g. 'foobar', for two different applications (2 war files deployed on Tomcat) causes --> Incorrect result size: expected 1, actual 2   --  org.springframework.dao.IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException 
Hi folks, I'm new here, I'm using jhipster, and I realized that when user opens a modal (like delete or create/edit dialogs), the browser's url is changed to the root ('#/'), is this a bug or a normal aspect?
it's not what happens for me... Which browser are you using?
@prasanthrc I'm by no means a security expert, but perhaps that's a little too specific for the scope of jhipster, and I think Spring Security has things covered pretty well... Having said that, I wonder how vulnerable is a jhipster application to fusking attacks on rest apis, what do you guys think?
sorry @jdubois this was my fault, I had put a href=\#\ in <a>
Is it a bad idea to use JHipster only as a RESTful webservice?
no, of course not
the AngularJS front end isn't mandatory, in fact one of my biggest clients just use the REST part
(and they have a Struts front-end on top of it!)
At the moment I am using Spring Roo to rapidly create a webservice but JHipster sounds and looks promising :)
So JHipster backend is already a restful api where I can pack any other frontend on, right?
yes, you can use the REST API with another front end
hey @jdubois , in order to use a different front end or client, is it necessary to create a custom CORS filter or something along the lines?
If the front end/client is from another domain, obviously...
it depends on your authentication mechanism, but yes you would need to follow how it works in JHipster
you can have a look at the Gatling tests, that's how they work
and they are generated using the same authentication mechanism as the one you selected for your app
probably using OAuth2 as an authentication mechanism... thanks for tip, I will check the gatling tests and adapt what I see there to my own needs...
on a semi-related note, I'm having trouble figuring out how to use the `oauth/authorize` endpoint, I always get an error telling me my request can't be processed :worried: 
Last time we did a joint proposal with microsoft and they were bragging about the latest MS CRM capability to cook up a custom application in an hour, next time i see them I'm gonna show them Jhipster and application prod ready in 10  mins :sunglasses: 
@jdubois you should start a commercial model as well :joy:  I would happily make my clients buy those licence. ha ha
@deepu105 hey man, here are the `grunt build`results with compass enabled:
[![before-compass.png](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/JbuG/thumb/before-compass.png)](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/JbuG/before-compass.png)
[![after-compass.png](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/Hoxd/thumb/after-compass.png)](https://files.gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster/Hoxd/after-compass.png)
the first one has the concurrent task and the second doesn't...
I don't know much about angular.js so I don't know it's jhipster, angular or just me.\n\n- When editing a html (eg. main.html) \n- Rerun production\n- Refresh browser\n=> nothing changes ??
Anyone uses jhipster-loaded in your current app ? How do you compare with JRebel or any other tool you use for class hot loading ?
@piedrahitac thanks man, so concurrent task definitely seems useless ill put in a PR to remove it
I guess concurrent is perfectly fine but we are not utilizing it properly, did some reading and found this online
> You've probably heard that quote before, but it's true. Before you start micro-optimising every part of your Gruntfile, the first thing you should do is measure how long the build takes to run in its current form. Then, after each refactoring, analyse the build's performance to ensure you've not introduced a regression.\n\n> For example, we recently added the grunt-concurrent plug-in into our Grunt set-up; it sped up the processing of two sub tasks with RequireJS, but it actually increased the build time for our Sass tasks. This was because the two sub tasks within Sass were running at 0.8 and 0.2 seconds.\n\n> Running them side-by-side with the 0.5 second penalty of spinning up a second instance of Grunt increased the time to 1.3 seconds! This is because there is a cost to running two tasks in parallel: normally about 0.5 seconds, the time it takes to spin up another instance of Grunt.
Currently, only the svgmin and imagemin tasks are configured to run in parallel, and since a plain jhipster project doesn't ship with a lot of images to optimize, the time penalty is too costly... Still, I wonder how many of us really need to optimize a bunch of images so that it justifies running those tasks concurrently...
Maybe those tasks could be sequential by default and we could add a tip/trick for those who need to optimize a lot images telling them how to modify their gruntfile?
Ya i was thinking the same, coz i have added around 50 images and few svg but still concurrent penalty is more than total execution time. @jdubois what say shall i push a pr with concurrent removed and a tip to add it if needed? 
https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-uml is officially released awesome!! well done @MathieuAA
that's awesome
WISH WE HAD THIS A FEW DAYS AGO! WOULD'VE SAVED ME SO MUCH MANUAL CODING
me too man, mee too!! :crying_cat_face:  coz as part of TD process my team anyway have to do a class model diagram and it would have been way easier to generate entities with that 
@jdubois please make the UML project mention in the docs so that people are aware of it
seriously though, would have saved me just gross amounts of coding haha, it's insane.
easily 40 hours
For the jhipster-uml project -> yes it's going to be announced, we just finish up the docs, and I'll put it on the website as a \beta\ project
@atomfrede  i regularly see this in my gradle console output

though everything works fine as usual, but I have no idea why this gets printed always? any advice?
@deepu105 What task are you executing?
@deepu105 try to set an explicit version for ``metrics-healtcheck`` and ``metrics-graphite``: 
```\n compile group: 'io.dropwizard.metrics', name: 'metrics-graphite', version: dropwizard_metrics_version\n compile group: 'io.dropwizard.metrics', name: 'metrics-healthchecks', version: dropwizard_metrics_version\n```\n
Normally the ``gradle`` spring boot plugin brings a set of \blessed\ versions, so you don't need to explicity provide a version, but maybe something is broken
@deepu105 I don't see the output here with a fresh generated application. An older one doesn't show the ``Resource missing`` either.
hmmm ill check it out
thanks @atomfrede 
btw i was doing bootrun
@deepu105 Ok, me too. Don't get the errors you have with the latest release.
My first attempt was not successful:\nyo jhipster\nmodule.js:338\n    throw err;\n          ^\nError: Cannot find module 'ejs'\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:336:15)\n\n
Was your npm install  properly executed? 
i just updated, deleted npm and npm-cache and got the same error:
module.js:338\nthrow err;\n^
sudo npm install -g ejs
i'm on windows most of the time. Will try with cmd.exe run as admin
also did installed express but not sure if that did the trick...
We have this discussion on bower repository. Do you think authors need to provide release assets for different module systems? Or maybe there should be one release asset with UMD format? Or maybe just one release asset in just one module system?
Or one release asset containing multiple builds for different module systems.
For now JSPM seems the only package manager that consumes release assets.
JSPM seems to leverage current publishing strategies
Personally I think authors should not care about 1000 ways to package their project. They just need to declare what module system they use (at the same time declaring module system they expect of dependencies) and publish only in that module system.
How about: https://gist.github.com/dherman/7568080
Isn't this \standardized\ way of declaring modules?
Another question: github.jspm.io is unbelivably slow (20 seconds to load jquery.min.js). Is it known issue?
Is System.js implementation of standardized interface?
I see some documentation about Loader interface here: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:module_loaders
But I can't find anything about it in ES6 draft: https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html
Could you help me find Loader specification?
Is specification of Loader final?
I think authors should publish to registries specific to the module format
So I think publishing tools should take the role of taking the sources and publishing in the right ways
I think we need ES6-specific registries that people can publish to
as well as to CommonJS
its much simpler than trying to publish multiple formats to the same registry (npm)
publish CommonJS to npm
and ES6 to something new
What about ES6 Loader specification?
loader has been moved out of the ES6 specification
it will be just a browser specification
I'm mainly concerned with browser environment
Because on server CJS is standard, there's no problem
Would it help if authors always provided builds for ES6 Loader?
Because for me ES6 Loaders seems like CJS for server
Did you read https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/1606 ?
Yes I saw that
I'm about to make following suggestion and I'd love your feedback:
I think ultimately we need publishing tools that can handle this stuff for people
1. Implement support for release assets (so no need to include builds in source).\n2. Force on authors to use standardized [ES6 Loader](http://guybedford.com/practical-workflows-for-es6-modules) as the only global dependency in builds.\n3. Force proper structure of files in builds.\n4. Force proper naming of release assets so we can skip GitHub API.\n5. Suggest using drop-in AMD, CJS, Global Script loaders / transcompilers that recognize Loader API.\n  - Probably the best Loader suggestion is for now [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)
We're not at a place yet to define these workflows unfortunately
I think it will still be another 6 months or so
we're still in teething
I agree with release assets
I agree with author in Es6
then we need publishing tools
that can provide different \publish operations\
and allow that to be an open evolving set of publishing targets
EG:
* compiled Es6 into CommonJS and publish to npm
* compile Es6 into a single file and publish to bower
/ github releases
but yeah it's not easy at the moment
I'm more concerned about existing plugins than ES6 transcompilation
what do you mean?
We need somehow to allow authors to create ecosystem builds for their existing components. Not only the new that are written in ES6 format.
That's why I think release assets are fastest way to go.
yes that's a good target
why not npm?
NPM allows only for one \attachment\ per version
And it's source that rather needs to be CJS-compatible.
I wouldn't put there builds that assume ES6 Loader in environment
And if you publish something to NPM it stays there forever.
Github Assets are more forgiving if we screw something up
And it's not that I want bower to support *only* relese assets as builds
Just standardize build format. And release assets are for now nice place to keep them.
but we have no standard output format unfortunately
System loader is standard now.
\Force on authors to use standardized ES6 Loader as the only global dependency in builds.\
ES6 Loader = System in global space
you mean System.register output?
Maybe I don't understand something
Does ES6 standard provide standardized way of defining modules?
But not in ES6 syntax, in ES5 syntax.
no it doesn't
but System.register is a format that fully matches the semantics
and I would like it to be as good as a standard
I've worked with TC39 members on creating it
They didn't agree to standardize it?
I don't understand why they standardized loading, but not defining.
because spec doesn't standardise things which are not of concern in the future
so spec is just Es6 syntax and how it loads
how we support older browsers is up to us to work out
System.register is your extension of Loader, right?
it is
Any other extensions except it?
that offer the same functionality?
No. How SytemJS is deviating from standard ES6 Loader :)
all extensions are non-standard
Everything in https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/tree/master/lib
It's shame they didn't standardize System.register API
Now I need to persuade people to it
yeah but i think that can be as good as a standard for making modules work in Es5
as it is the only ES5 format that fully-supports all ES6 features
Angular2 uses it
https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/test-main.js
note that the browser loader itself is still not a confirmed spec
How about something like this:
now that Loader is out of Es6, it still has to be rewritten as a browser spec
so things are still up in the air unfortunately
Do you think its API will change?
yeah it's looking likely unfortunately
I think they may simplify it
remove a lot of the functions
So System.js won't be a standard interface anymore, right?
I will continue to adapt it
so it will track the spec changes
retaining its features
what?
nothing, I'm little annoyed by this spec changes
oh right
yeah try working on for a year and half
I'm planning to write a blog post soon and explain a lot of this stuff
so people know where the spec stands
Front-end world needs standard build format for components
yes desperately
and we need it now, not in 3 years time
the web needs to catch up now
Bower has a chance of standarizing it, but I want to make right choice
As for how build should look like
I thought System.js API can be good match
But now, I don't know what to use anymore
so i'm planning to write a SystemJS v1 release
representing the upcoming spec changes
Maybe just CJS
CJS is a good bet
Or maybe just AMD?
not AMD
Why? Can't you easily use AMD module from CJS?
yeah, but then you're in UMD
UMD is a big fail
lowest common denomenator wins
which means everything ends up as global
I don't know
I'm focusing on trying to piece together an ecosystem that can support code written today
and then have an eye to the future
CJS expects few globals to be available and synchronous imports
CJS techniques are looking like the biggest consolidation we have
yes dynamic loading is screwed
until this spec stabilises
Pure AMD solves this
maybe
For sure browserify allows for easy CJS -> AMD compilation
So it can be used for builds
Actually it's not even necessary to use browserify
define(function (require, exports, module) { }); is possbible in AMD as far as I can see
I don't know. For now I'd bet with AMD as standard format. Let me know if you have any better ideas, ok? :)
difficulty is it is not just the format
but also the resolution process
how do I write code that uses jquery
globals are the best we have without a standard browser loader
or npm
\third party dependency problem\
needs a registry
and a standard loading system
As for loading system - I hope it'll get standardized soon
For sure if build format is right, we can develop an adapter for it
As for registry - yes, that's more serious problem
I think we can use npm's. Just provide builds for browsers.
Builds for browsers = AMD format.
But loading is not necessairly in AMD, you can use CJS to load AMD
And loader like System.js to load asynchronously
(dependencies)
the browser loader will get standardised better and sooner if people show they want it and support it
that is what I'm trying to do basically
pave the use cases and get the community backing
then standards will come easily
AMD for browsers is difficult to argue these days
because we need globals
when it comes down to it
@guybedford What are System.register features that AMD doesn't support?
ES6-style live bindings and circular references
Could you give some examples really quick?
Or link?
https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader#circular-references--bindings
But that's loading stuff. Can't you use AMD-style defining and use System.js for circular dependencies support?
each module format has its own binding and circular reference interpretation
they are edge cases yes
but affect general handling
```\ndefine('polymer', ['polymer-element'], function() { ... });\ndefine('polymer-element', ['polymer'], function() { ... });\n```\n\nIs this invalid definition?
what do you mean?
Can System.js consume something like this? (circular definition)
oh right, yeah that's fine - it's an AMD circular references
note named defines should be avoided
why?
well feel free to use them
but it doesn't allow module portability
that is, systemjs has its own registry format for multi-version
which doesn't support that
but we work around named defines
so its no issue actually
So AMD's \define\ supports circular dependencies :)
It's AMD's \require\ that doesn't
no AMD supports circular dependencies
but its different to ES6 and CommonJS circular dependencies
Maybe some link? :(
http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#circular
http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_cycles
And ES6? The same as CJS?
https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader#circular-references--bindings
all different!
What happens when you load AMD / CommonJS module with System.js?
What is the circular references behavior in each case?
exactly as it is for each format
Is this system.js thing or es6-module-loader?
the functionality is between both
the exact cjs and amd handling is in SystemJS
I sent PR with explanation: https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader/pull/253
@guybedford To put is straight: It's not always possible to compile ES6 to AMD, right?
What are ES6 live bindings?
export var p = 5;
if I change p, the export value changes
import { p } from 'p'
matches any local changes in the originating module
System.register is the only defining form that supports ES6 modules, right?
AMD and CJS are not capable of this.
Es6 can compile to CommonJS fine
but you can't match exact semantics
it doesnt
matter though in most cases
but System.register can be a true polyfill path
OK, so choice is simple. System.register :)
compiling Es6 to CommonJS is a good bet and the most likely initial direction
when browsers start to support ES6 more natively, then System.register will be important for polyfills
Uh
@guybedford What is the format System.js transcompiles loaded files to?
System.register is the module format
Would it help if release assets contained already transcompiled code?
Maybe jspm's output can be common build format
Hm? Maybe jspm could be publishing tool browsers?
https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/1633
Would love to hear feedback on this - should all packages allow `require('pkg/submodule')`? Or could we restrict all packages to only expose main?
Considering making the above a configurable option in package.json with the default as false
Any reasonable use cases to suggest this default would restrict at all?
Well, obviously when you want to use only part of package. E.g. http://moutjs.com/ is designed to be consumed in this way, as whole package is really heavy.
thanks, that makes sense... so we should always support it because requiring users to make lots of separate packages for separate functionality becomes impractical at some level, when wanting to make highly modular libs
I'm porting existing RequireJS application and it turns out each `paths` entry actually means two things. E.g. `foo -> components/foo` actually means `foo -> components/foo.js` + `foo/* -> components/foo/*.js`
So for example require('foo/bar') translates to `components/foo/bar.js`
It makes a lot of sense to me
this is map in SystemJS
In RequireJS map is primarily used for mapping names to names, not paths to paths.
Or rather prefixes to prefixes
yes, I guess I was still following the dream then of everything being a module name
map was the way to do that over paths
but users ended up preferring paths as it was what they expected
whereas module names aren't intuitive
but in the module loader names are becoming URIs so that these differences no longer matter
we're also stopping adding \.js\ automatically
which then becomes a bit confounding as to how to do the whole main / path thing
becomes two separate configs, which i guess is what is always was, just hidden
I'd make .js extension a default. Like having { nodeIdCompat: true } in RequireJS.
we can keep that behaviour for the AMD and CommonJS formats potentially
But it this change allows you to implement require('foo.css'), I'm all for it :)
but the ES6 default will be to expect extensions
for extensions, thinking of providing a configuration option:
modules: { 'styles/*.less': { plugin: 'less' } }
Is there a way to pass one extension through many plugins? Like middleware?
there is with plugin requires
import 'style.less!pluginA!pluginB'
but I think it's ugly
rather just write a new plugin that is the composition of the operations
inheritance of plugins over syntactical composition
because plugins are written as simple hooks, they are easy to extend
and compose at the hook level
pluginA.js\ntranslate: function(load) { return translate(load.source); }
It would be best if plugins could be some kind of gulp pipelines
But probably there's issue porting gulp to browser
pluginB.js\nimport { translateA } from 'pluginA';\nexport function translate(load) { return translateB(translateA(load.source)); }
You can easily create new gulp pipeline from existing ones
I don't see what the benefits would be over the above
{ 'styles/*.less': { plugin: require('gulp-less') } }
{ 'styles/*.less': { plugin: require('gulp-less').pipe(require('gulp-lol')) } }
something like this
why?
Maybe not gulp, but accepting function instead string would be nicer
Because you can inline this function in configuration
Accepting string is good for lazy loading probably
it could certainly be possible, but I'm not sure its something to encourage
With string you can't override existing plugin I guess
For example to make vendor '.less' requires to pass through additional transformer.
NVM you can
Yeah I don't think the cost is too much to create a local plugin module to do this, as it is important code
but yes, completely contrary to the webpack point of view
so this is what configuration might look like with the changes:
```javascript\nSystem.config({\n  // paths apply only on \/\ boundaries (app/..., underscore/...)\n  // map to any URI\n  paths: {\n    app: '/lib',\n    underscore: 'npm:underscore@1.2.3',\n    jquery: 'github:components/jquery@1.2.3'\n  },\n  // sites table is used to set mains (app, underscore exactly)\n  // (name from http://whatwg.github.io/loader/#browser-site-packages )\n  sites: {\n    app: '/lib/main.js',\n    underscore: 'npm:underscore@1.2.3/underscore.js',\n    jquery: 'github:components/jquery@1.2.3/jquery.js'\n  },\n  // map becomes contextual only\n  map: {\n    'github:components/jquery@1.2.3': {\n      sizzle: 'github:jquery/sizzle@2.3.4'\n    }\n  },\n  // meta configuration\n  // keys are any normalized / unnormalized URI - gives flexibility\n  // wildcard support goes through '/' boundaries\n  modules: {\n    '/lib/*': {\n      format: 'es6'\n    },\n    '/lib/styles/*.less': {\n      // plugin syntax would still be suported\n      plugin: 'less'\n    }\n    '/lib/some/global.js: {\n      deps: ['jquery'],\n      exports: 'blah'\n    }\n  }\n});\n```
Sites and paths are partly duplicated
Sites seems to support only .js mains
I think it's OK as long as `paths` are only overrides for paths extracted from `sites` (dirnames). Maybe it would be good if `paths` values were relative to sites dirnames.
Empty = the same
Probably it would be best if sites values could be objects with `{ path: 'xxx', main: 'yyy' }`
or strings, and then `path` and `main` are automatically extracted
sites would allow any type o main
great point!
sites can be used to generate default paths which can be overridden
@guybedford I mean sites should be allowed to be arrays of mains, not only single mains
yes that could be a spec suggestion, but without it, we have to do this
why?
I'm thinking from bower's perspective where people want to set main for CSS, not only JS. Maybe it doesn't apply here.
will have another option that may work with paths fallbacks though
Could sites keys be \bootstrap.css\ for example?
yes that would be fine
`bootstrap: 'bower:bootstrap@1.2.3/dist/bootstrap'`
Above would map both bootstrap.css and bootstrap.js
no neither
but you could map bootstrap to bootstrap.css or bootstrap.js
with sites I mean
What would be the behavior of `require('bootstrap.js')`?
would just load the URL
or may throw an error
I'm not sure what the spec plan is currently for unconfigured sites
sites: {\n}
site: {\n  'bootstrap.js': '...'\n}
but the js is kind or irrelevant here
What about `modules` values have the same format as configuration passed to `System.config`?
i.e. `paths` and `sites` instead `deps`
not sure I follow
NVM, I confused meaning of them.
I'm not sure what values of `deps` are supposed to mean
Are they sites names?
deps there is for shim configuration
What about `require('bootstrap/modal.css')`?
if we take your suggestion of deriving paths from sites
then that would do what we want it to
Note that js and css in bootstrap are in different directories: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/dist
then do require('bootstrap/css/modal.css')
```\nsites: {\n  'bootstrap': 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js',\n  'bootstrap.css': 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'\n},\npaths: {\n  'bootstrap': 'bootstrap/dist'\n}\n```\n\nright?
that could work if you wanted it
I'd leave wildcards in paths
paths only apply as wildcards now
```\npaths: {\n  'bootstrap/*.css': 'bootstrap/dist/css/*.css'\n}\n```
`'bootstrap'` could mean `'bootstrap/*'`
But being explicit wouldn't hurt too
I'm not sure the benefit outweights the complexity
the 'bootstrap' path gives you enough
`require('bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css')`, `require('bootstrap/js/bootstrap.js')` if you want more than that, ask bootstrap to use a simpler folder structure
yeah, good luck with that :D
I don't see what's wrong with the extra typeing though
we don't complain about it when doing\n<link href=\bootstrap/css/boostrap.css\>
I think consumers expect paths for specific extension to be relative to site of specific extension
not sure I follow
so if `bootstrap.css` site points to `bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css`, they expect `bootstrap/modal.css` in `bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap/modal.css`
I'm not sure
bootstrap.css/bootstrap-theme.css should point to the right thing
It kinda makes sense, but it's hard to digest for me :)
it was your suggestion!
jspm 0.10.1 is out https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/releases/tag/0.10.1
Oh yes, I've found jspm on gitter, what an awesome feeling!
@guybedford I've added documentation for browserify and webpack to my package's README, and now next I wanted to add a jspm example. Browserify and webpack both support config options inside of package.json, but to achieve the same things with JSPM it requires overrides, but since overrides are not (yet?) placeable inside of package.json I haven't done jspm yet. Check out what I have in my README so far: https://github.com/infamous/infamous
Are package overrides supporte in package.json yet? Something like the following?\n\n```\n{\n  \jspm\: {\n    \directories\: {\n      \packages\: \party/jspm\\n    },\n    \configFile\: \jspm_config.js\\n    \dependencies\: {\n      \army-knife\: \npm:army-knife@^0.0.4\\n      \async\: \npm:async@^0.9.0\\n      \big\: \github:MikeMcl/big.js@^2.5.1\\n      \bignumber\: \github:MikeMcl/bignumber.js@^1.4.1\\n      \bootstrap\: \^3.2.0\\n      \bootstrap-datepicker\: \github:eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker@^1.3.0\\n      \famous\: \github:trusktr/famous@trusktr\\n      \infamous\: \npm:infamous@^0.0.10\\n      \james-bond\: \npm:james-bond@^0.0.0\\n      \jquery\: \^2.1.1\\n      \jquery-tooltipster\: \github:iamceege/tooltipster@^3.2.6\\n      \jsfromhell\: \github:jonasraoni/JSFromHell@master\\n      \jss\: \npm:jss@^0.10.1\\n      \jss-nested\: \npm:jss-nested@^0.1.4\\n      \leaflet\: \github:RickMohr/Leaflet@better-inertial-scrolling\\n    },\n    \overrides\: {\n      \infamous\: {\n        \directories\: {\n          \lib\: \src\\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```
I guess not yet:\n\n```js\n/*\n  options.format\n  options.shim\n  options.dependencies\n  options.map\n  options.removeJSExtensions\n  options.transpile\n  options.minify\n  options.sourceURLBase\n*/\nexports.compileDir = function(dir, options) {\n  dir = path.resolve(dir);\n```
@trusktr that's awesome you're getting together an example that works in all environments
it would be really interesting to share the setup you're using to support all systems
for the overrides, I'm not sure I understand why you need to override your own repo though?
point taken on making this process easier though
i've just created a new project using jspm v0.10.3. i'm importing a file, but for some reason it's not transpiling ES6 to ES5 (i just get an error).
can't see anything about this in the release notes. am i missing something?
i thought system.js loaded traceur, but i can't see it being loaded now.
ahh looks like a fix was applied to system.js but it's not being used by latest jspm yet?
@guybedford I'd be glad to share! What do you mean by \the setup you're using to support all systems for the overrides\? As in the package.json? I don't need to override my own package, but overrides in general are useful for packages used alongside jspm-compliant packages, and for testing branches. It'd be a pain to have to add overrides into a registry for every branch you want to work with.
@OliverJAsh @guybedford Yeah, it would be very cool if SystemJS would automatically load traceur and es6-module-loader. For now, you need to also include those in your html. For example: https://github.com/trusktr/portfolio/blob/master/app/views/pages/home.html.ejs
Here's [package.json for infamous](https://github.com/infamous/infamous/blob/master/package.json).
So far that works with browserify and webpack. famousify is a dependency for the browserify workflow, so as a sideeffect other workflows will pull in famousify but not use it. I guess disk space is cheap right?
So for the jspm workflow so far, I have the jspm property in the package.json, and it contains only directories. I'm slightly confused when the jspm.dependencies is needed. Could you describe all the cases when you'd want jspm.dependencies vs not? Also, I noticed with the browserify and webpack workflows that it's possible to have all code in the private space (e.g. the src folder) then compile things into the public folder. In browserify, the package management seems to need to happen in the public folder, so development code is accessible by the browser. How do we prevent this like we can with browserify and webpack (see my two [workflow examples in the README](https://github.com/infamous/infamous/blob/master/README.md))?
I'm desperately trying to get system.register module format working with system.js and I don't seem to be getting anywhere.
It works fine for requires within a library, but when I jspm install a dependency that is build with system.js, all my named imports from the library are undefined.
When I dig into the jspm generated code, it looks like maybe jspm is confused and is writing out some commonjs stuff.
For example, if I do `jspm install aurelia-metadata` which is build into system.register modules. I get a file that looks like this:\n\n__metadata@0.2.0.js__\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = require(\github:aurelia/metadata@0.2.0/system/index\);\n```
github:aurelia/metadata@0.2.0/system/index itself is a system.register defined module. But this bridge code used by the loader looks like commonjs to me. Is jspm getting confused and generating the wrong thing? thus breaking my exports? Or is something else going on.
Ok, it looks like I got things working. It seems that the cli just doens't detect the register format. You *must* specify it in the jpm config format section.
@guybedford I didn't see the register format specified in the docs as an option but found it by looking through the code. It would be great to add this. I think another important thing to add is that you *must* specify it for register formatted modules or they won\u2019t install correctly.
@EisenbergEffect You should be able to add \format\:\<module_type>\ to the override, or to the package.json of the dependency itself. I'm guessing it would be \format\:\register\ in your case.
@EisenbergEffect The package.json for one of my libs looks like this (with parts omitted):\n\n```js\n{\n  \name\: \infamous\\n  \version\: \0.0.18\\n  \description\: \A UI library.\\n  \format\: \es6\ // <-- Right here.\n  \main\: \infamous.js\\n  // ...\n  \dependencies\: {\n    \6to5\: \^2.4.3\\n    \army-knife\: \^0.0.4\\n    \core-js\: \^0.3.3\\n    \famous\: \git+https://github.com/trusktr/famous.git#trusktr\\n    \famousify\: \^0.1.5\\n    \jss\: \^0.10.1\\n  },\n  // ...\n  \jspm\: { // and here.\n    \directories\: {\n      \lib\: \src\\n    }\n  }\n}\n```
Thanks. I got it worked out by adding it to the jpsm section.
@guybedford Does it work in both the jspm section, and at the top level of package.json?
It\u2019s not exactly documented\u2026so hopefully Guy can make a few small additions there for future travellers.
Could I move directories to the top level?
I have no idea.
I know. We're the ones needing more docs. xD
I have multipel formats I\u2019m supporting so I put the format data for jspm in the jspm section.
oops, haha. Thought I was at the command line.
@guybedford I think you mentioned somewhere that the properties in jspm can be put at the top level of package.json, but preference to the jspm section?
@OliverJAsh are you saying your loader files weren't updating properly? Did you run an install or `jspm init` after upgrading as that should have refreshed the project loader files. If not, does `jspm dl-loader` work?
@trusktr you just need to modify the package.json for the individual branch you're working on if that is the case rather than doing a registry override?
@trusktr the files are included automatically - you only need `system.js` in the page for everything to work
@trusktr the jspm property in the package.json acts as an override of the package.json itself. jspm.dependencies == dependencies
@EisenbergEffect which version of jspm are you using?
I just tested `jspm install aurelia-metadata` with jspm@0.10.3 and it is definitely creating the right main module
this may be an update issue
The way the \jspm\ property behaves is documented at https://github.com/jspm/registry/wiki/Configuring-Packages-for-jspm#prefixing-configuration
@trusktr does that cover your questions about it?
The  latest release works. I figured it out and published one with the correct configuration.
@EisenbergEffect great, so you didn't need to set the custom config anymore?
The documentation at that link doesn\u2019t mention the \u201cregister\u201d format as an option or that it is required for correct install of register module libraries.
It shouldn't be required - auto-detection is supposed to work
So, I would just extend that a litle bit maybe with a few notes to that effect and everything would be all good :)
I also verified with my version that it was auto-detecting correctly I think?
yes working on improving docs
still rolling out the last release implications at the moment
I have the format prop in my package.json now. It wouldn\u2019t detect it without that. I looked a the source on github and that looked to be correct as well.
when i installed it without the format prop, it was creating the main entry point file with a System.register in it so it was definitely detecting correctly
the update may not have cleared the cache, so may have needed an `install -f` to work
but yes, can be good to set `format` to be sure in these cases
System.register is always detected 100% though
because it's not hard to misclassify
Hmm. Maybe it was a cache issue.
I\u2019m going to include the format in the jspm metadata anyway\u2026just to be absolutely clear though.
But I didn\u2019t see any code in the cli to detect the register format.
sounds like it could have been - minor upgrades of the endpoints auto-flush the cache, but this bug fix didn't include a cache bump (I probably should have included this)
the format detection comes from SystemJS itself
I saw this: https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/blob/master/lib/build.js#L254
But there was no code path taht returned `{format:\u2019register'}`
yes you can also enforce the format through meta
\format register\;
at the top of the source
mostly useful for ES6 without any module syntax, or CommonJS similarly
so that's picking up any of that present
So, the cli uses system.js itself to detect the format during package installation?
ah I see what you mean
Because it was definitely generating the wrong code for the main module. It was detecting commonjs.
could I have tried this after you fixed this around 4 hours ago?
I've created https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/issues/358
this detectFormat function does look like it needs to be updated
Yep :smile: It was fixed about 5 hours ago.
ok right
thanks so much - yes I need to add a register then
Maybe 5
6
ok that explains it then, thanks for clarifying
If you want to see theproblem, try explicitly installing aurelia-metadata@0.2.0
that should be built with system.register, but without the config in the package json
ok thanks will try that
@guybedford Oh, system.js now loads traceur and es6-module-loader automatically/!? I must try.
As for branches, I mean working with branches I don't have push access to and needing an override becomes more work. Because when I change the name=endpoint:source of a package, it will no longer get the override from jspm registry, so I gotta do it at the command line. Would be nice to store it locally in package.json. :D
Yeah, the #prefixing-configuration detail in the registry wiki helps. I think what's tricky about the docs is that they have been spread around, some in the readme's of multiple repos, and some in the wikis of multiple repos. I think it'd be very nice to have them all in a central place, perhaps on jspm.io. All of the docs, jspm-cli usage, jspm registry, jspm-plugins, etc, can all be in one place.
I'd say just go for the centralized docs on jspm.io. It'd be totally worth it.
ANd of course, use the jspm workflow for it, as a showcase, so tha contributing to the docs involves cloning and using the jspm workflow
> the update may not have cleared the cache, so may have needed an install -f to work but yes, can be good to set format to be sure in these cases\n\n-f? What's that? Seems like something that should be a default and probably would've prevent lots of the issues I posted on github. xD
> but this bug fix didn't include a cache bump\n\nIdea: Maybe use the commit hash of jspm (or combination of hashes based also on the registry and plugins). So if I the commit hash of jspm, registry, or plugins change, then it'd cause a cache bump every update. Might be slightly slower, but better than having unexpected behaviors.
@trusktr jspm install -f is an install that skips the local cache, not something you want as a default, but useful when merging updates sometimes, although updates are supposed to flush the cache when they aren't backwards compatible with the cache
we use the minor version of the endpoint itself as a hash, combined with the jspm minor version at https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/blob/master/lib/package.js#L36, I just forgot to bump it when making the change as I didn't realise it was cache-breaking
I published a blog post/screencast about JSPM if anyone's interested:
http://glenmaddern.com/articles/javascript-in-2015
Great screencast. I'd put it on frontpage :)
yes, already taken https://github.com/jspm/jspm.io/pull/17, working on updating the website v soon
@EisenbergEffect I've included the register detection now in https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/commit/451100c429633650e7ef8d9a41bd81ab92917106. Thanks for pointing this out.
What time zone are you in? In in SF.
@guybedford We have a bunch of windows users that consistently have the issue \unknown command \u201cunzip\u201d\u201d when doing a jspm install. Any ideas?
I'm thinking jspm needs to add unzip as a dependency
@AshleyGrant You fixed it by manually doing `npm install -g unzip` correct?
yes
in Cape Town here, it's close to GMT
@EisenbergEffect yes this can be improved it is because of
https://github.com/jspm/github/blob/master/github.js#L356
posted https://github.com/jspm/github/issues/17
Is there a command argument I can give to ignore CERT_UNTRUSTED errors?
@guybedford We have windows users that, due to the unzip issue, very quickly end up exhausting their github rate limit. So, then they get that error. When they do `jspm endpoint config github` some are still getting the rate limit issue even after the credentials test succeeded.
@AshleyGrant you may need to update Node / npm to remove teh CERT_UNTRUSTED error
@guybedford This user that gets the rate limit error from GitHub is also saying they get it on Mac as well\u2026even after they have configured it with their credentials. Any ideas?
let me know if that helps
@EisenbergEffect I noticed this today, and I posted a fix at https://github.com/jspm/github/commit/11605e1cb80b177eb2f2c89e5f5dfcc231e2da54
will do a release shortly
@EisenbergEffect actually that may not be a fix
do you know specifically a dependency it is failing on
I have found that this only affects GitHub asset release projects in my tests
I think boostrap
yes that would be the one
so I'm a little stuck here
when I set credentials on the asset request to the GitHub API, I get an S3 error response
is it related to how Github changed their release stuff?
what change did they do?
it seems like the issue may be at GitHub...
because it's not taking auth on a URL it provides
and without auth is hitting the rate limit
the request line is https://github.com/jspm/github/blob/master/github.js#L385
that is an authless api.github request
I thought they changed their release stuff recently\u2026it might hae been months ago actually...
adding `auth` gives a 400 error
let\u2019s see what the twitter verse says real quick..I think i know some github people
created an issue at https://github.com/jspm/github/issues/22
Is their api the only way to get what you need?
its just downloading from the URL listed at the response object in https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#list-releases-for-a-repository
there is an \html_url\ as wel
which may have a better rate limit
but there will still be an eventual rate limit there too
If I go to https://github.com/mozilla/sweet.js/archive/v0.7.3.zip over and over, would I be rate limited?
and download over and over.
If you pretend to be a browser, and visit that URL instead of a GitHub API url, would that have the same rate limits?
no it's not got rate limits anything like the same
you're right
Ok I've added https://github.com/jspm/github/commit/958e9d0f96cd9f6120a1381142d72ed40bc4a2b0 as a workaround
How does bower do it?
they don't download release assets from github
but this is a GitHub api bug
I just don't know how to report these things
support@github.com seems to be the only way.
Would be nice if they had a bug tracker.
They're good at replying.
I got response on twitter.
You should see it now.
ok I'm just doing some low-level request testing
ok it was my fault after all
(of course!)
see https://github.com/jspm/github/commit/0e1de56e2041d220e191b27801c13a1d46d5cfc9
Man\u2026jspm is one slick piece of work. You got to have at  least one bug every once in a while to keep it interesting :)
haha, it's been a few more bugs than that
has certainly been interesting though
Seems like by the time I'm done with work today you'll be zzzzzzzzzzz
It always take two days for a round of communication.
On github issues.
Well, a whole day actually
yeah the SF timezone isn't ideal from here
@guybedford May be interesting for you: https://stuk.github.io/jszip/
I haven't tried it
thanks, I'll check it out
@guybedford sorry for the long time to reply. I'm updating Node now. apparently I was on 0.10.34 (35) is current for Windows
I'll report if it helps the issue
@guybedford looks like that fixed it. I updated nodejs and then followed the instructions here: https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting#upgrading-on-windows to update my windows npm install to the 2.x versions 
Thanks for the help resolving my issue.
@guybedford So infamous package.json now contains\n\n```js\n  \jspm\: {\n    \registry\: \jspm\\n    \directories\: {\n      \lib\: \src\\n    }\n  },\n```\n\nand the name for infamous in the jspm registry resolves to the github repo. Looks good?
I symlinked package.json to jspm.json. When I first started with jspm, I was feeling that since bower.json is separate from package.json, why not have jspm.json be separate too, so I symlinked package.json to jspm.json. It\u2019s not related at all to the .jspm.jsons inside jspm_packages. It was my newbness at jspm. The workflow that I\u2019ll add to infamous will be all cleaned up.
jspm 0.10.4 has been released - https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/releases/tag/0.10.4
@EisenbergEffect this includes the ratelimit fixes we worked on
don't know if it was issued before but it seems like \jspm clean\ doesn't remove folders of packages installed via npm: or github:
jspm clean only removes packages not being used in the current project
you need to uninstall them first
ok , thx for the info
@guybedford Am I supposed to put `\registry\: \jspm\u201d` in package.json\u2019s jspm field if the package will be installed from `github:`?
@guybedford Or is it only meant for command line overrides? And should it be in the jspm-registry override? I think auto setting of this would alleviate confusion.
Seems like I can avoid confusion by just putting it everywhere, thus having jspm-cli auto set it would help new users (and me the not-so-new too).
Error getting package config for github:jspm/nodelibs-process. Unable to check repo package.json for release, status code 401. Any ideas?
@ricardomatias you've probably hit the github rate limits?
try authenticating
@trusktr I finally agree with you... :)
see https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/issues/360
thanks for pushing to make things easier
Error downloading github:jspm/nodelibs-tty. Bad response code 406. (With authentication back on.)
@guybedford Sweet. Yeah, `jspm` being the actual override, along with treating command line and registry overrides as the `jspm` property itself (thus they wouldn\u2019t have `jspm` properties in them) makes much intuitive sense. I actually had no idea it wasn\u2019t like that.
@guybedford Thanks for getting the release out so fast!
Ping ping ping! I\u2019d like to get the jspm workflow for infamous published tonight. :D Just #380 needs a fix (or is it my fault)?
@EisenbergEffect sure! Also aiming to look at the https://github.com/jspm/github/issues/17 issue sometime this month, just have a lot to prioritise right now.
I understand\u2026trust me :)
Another github creds bug. Here\u2019s a screenshot from a user: http://www.screencast.com/t/YFUmnwum2aLC
Looks like if someone hasn\u2019t set the credentials, then the object is undefined.
As a side note\u2026if there\u2019s any way to not use the github api and instead use browser links, I think that would make things nicer. Another recommendation is to make the warning about github credentials a bit more obvious. I notice that people are missing that.
An alternative might be to instead of showing a warning, prompt if the user would like to set up auth?
but that could get super annoying
Another idea is\u2026if the github request fails with a rate limit error, provide  a special error message with instructions for how to set it up.
Maybe even ask them at that point with a prompt.
yes exactly - there's an issue tracking that
https://github.com/jspm/github/issues/20
Cool. Something like \u201cRequeest for package X failed due to a GitHub API rate limit. To fix this issue, configure jspm with your GitHub credentials. Would you like to do this now and retry the install?\
ok I've published jspm-github 0.9.10 with a fix for optional release auth
yes exactly
> prompt if the user would like to set up auth\n\n`-y` could skip that. Also, an alternative would be not to use api.github.com?
@guybedford Would you be OK with replacing the current help output of `jspm -k`/`jspm` with something generated using a formatting tool that can make columns, etc? If so, I can make some PRs. There\u2019s stuff out there, wouldn\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel.
FOr example, command is small, and would handle output formatting for `jspm \u2014help`: https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander
It would be nice not to have to worry about credentials. @guybedford Any conceivable way to do that? npm seems to work without a hitch, but github gives issues.
Does `npm` use api.github.com? I never see rate limit warnings from `npm`.
npm does support github release assets?
But releases can be obtained without accessing api.github.com
release assets, not releases. how?
What are release assets vs releases?
In my nomenclature releases are git tags, and release assets are https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#list-assets-for-a-release
I don\u2019t know what that\u2019s for. Why is it needed? I see releases here: https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/releases/tag/0.10.4
https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/tags
jspm could scrape those pages, and get release tags, bypassing the rate-limited api.github.com.
So you can skip putting distribution files inside source. JSPM recognizes when release (tag) has attached built source, and uses it instead.
What are distribution files? Like .gitignore, etc?
compiled JS files
yeah. So what do you mean prevent from putting those in source?
I don\u2019t store compiled files in my repo. Would that be it?
I\u2019m using npm\u2019s postinstall script to build the dist files, so the user has them after installing.
And building with nodejs tools so it works on any platform.
@sheerun So that asset api lets you tell github what from your repo *not* to put in the release archive?
Release Asset API allows you to upload custom attachments for releases
Including archived source with built JS
JSPM supports this distribution method
How would this compare to simply downloading the zip file found on github for a specific tag?
GitHub allows you to download on-the-fly-generated archives of tags and commits.
They are different from manually uploaded release assets
Release assets is a concept specific only to GitHub
Oh ok, I see, and so what is jspm doing? Is it checking for manually uploaded releases, and preferring those over the generated ones?
exactly
I kind of don\u2019t know if I like that more than the generated releases. The generated ones are basically just an archive of the repo files, right?
I think I prefer to get what I see.
As far as a github: enpoint goes, since it\u2019s git. I can understand getting manually determined things from npm, since it\u2019s not git.
I have an idea. jspm could default to the generated archives, and use manual archives if specified, to avoid touching api.github.com?
https://github.com/jspm/github/issues/6
I haven\u2019t actually tried hitting github.com (no api) over and over though. Have a collection of proxies. They wouldn\u2019t know. 
What does it mean when jspm install spits back a 406 Bad Response ? Getting this from several github repos, just curious about it.
This sounds like GitHub rate limits? It could be worth ensuring you're using the latest version of jspm as there were some fixes in this recently.
So, the biggest issue we keep coming into contact with is Github api usage stuff.
Rate limits happen a lot for us because Aurelia is broken into many repositories. So to bring it down requires a bunch of api calls.
If something fails, then people have to run it again\u2026and then they hit the rate limit.
They often don\u2019t know or realize.
So, they get frustrated right away just trying to use our starter kit sample.
If there\u2019s any way to not use the Github api and accomplish the same thing\u2026I think it would make a big difference.
You can put creds in\u2026but that\u2019s just another barrier to entry...
I agree.
npm never asks me for github creds.
jspm is the first package manager I\u2019ve experienced that asks for creds.
I'm trying to install Leaflet which currently fails due to #289. I don't understand the workaround mentioned there though: \ The workaround is to add ignore: \debug\ to the package.json override\. All I could find about overrides is the registry which seems to host a bunch of package.json overrides. But how can I do that locally in my own projects package.json for Leaflet?
Yeah, leaflet is tricky. @guybedford 
Yeah, I saw your comments on the issue...looks like you got around the issue though. Any hints?
I haven\u2019t gotten around them yet. I made a bash script to handle leaflet from github:\n\n```sh\n    # both jspm.overrides and jspm.scripts.postinstall would come handy here!\n    jspm install -y leaflet=github:RickMohr/Leaflet@better-inertial-scrolling -o '{ \registry\: \npm\ \main\:\dist/leaflet\ \dependencies\: { \css\: \jspm:css@^0.1.0\ }, \shim\: { \dist/leaflet\: { \deps\: [\./leaflet.css!\], \exports\: \L\ } } }' &&\\\n    cd party/jspm/github/RickMohr/Leaflet@better-inertial-scrolling/ && npm install &&\\\n    echo 'module.exports = require(\github:RickMohr/Leaflet@better-inertial-scrolling/dist/leaflet\);' > ../Leaflet@better-inertial-scrolling.js &&\\\n    cd - &&\\\n\necho \ --- All done.\u201d\n```
I don\u2019t like having to have a shell script though. The problem with leaflet is it doesn\u2019t use modules. It relies on `npm install` to build into a single global module. Jspm isn\u2019t handling that.
@guybedford A simple `\u201dpostinstall\u201d:\u201dnpm install\` script would be much more preferable than this shell script.
And of course, my locally persisted registry idea https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/pull/370 too.
With those two things, problem solved, even if it\u2019s not the ideal solution in terms of what you\u2019d like jspm to do, at least it would allow a road block to be easily cleared. We can\u2019t assume every package on earth will follow standard practices.
@guybedford I\u2019ve updated https://github.com/jspm/registry/wiki/Configuring-Packages-for-jspm That will help new users so much.
@guybedford I\u2019m not clear on how stemmed dev/production works, and it seems like one would want dev and local simultaneously, dev and remote simultaneously, production and local simultaneously, or production and remote simultaneously. I can imagine production+remote for apps using tried and true CDNs like google for libs like jquery for example. Unless setmode local and setmode dev are changing two different things about the project, I\u2019d feel that dev/production should be toggled with setmode, and local/remote some other command.
@trusktr Thank you very much for the writeup. I had hoped it'd be a bit simpler than that too
@trusktr leaflet does just need someone to publish the build to GitHub
I know its work, but that really is the best solution for now, just like Bower sometimes needs special repos for distributions
@trusktr thanks for looking into the wiki updates
For the package configuration guide, it might be worth separating this into two guides
1. configuring existing packages
 2. configuring your own package
@guybedford I thought about that.
I put it in the registry wiki for now though.
The way it was written was to just cover the process of configuring existing packages in order
@trusktr the production workflows are missing yes
I actually removed the jspm setmode production
because it wasn't working as well as it should
so the goal is to put something together well at some point
but time is a big constraint
@guybedford Any chance of coming up with a github solution that doesn\u2019t require credentials? 
idea regarding dev vs prod in package.son:\n\n```js\n{\n  \jspm\: {\n    \dev\: {\n      \directories\: {\n        \baseURL\: \src\\n        \packages\: \src/jspm\\n      },\n      \configFile\: \src/cfg.js\\n    },\n    \production\: {\n      \directories\: {\n        \baseURL\: \public\\n        \packages\: \public/jspm\\n      },\n      \configFile\: \public/cfg.js\\n    },\n    \dependencies\: {\n      \css\: \^0.1.0\\n      \famous\: \github:trusktr/famous@jspm\\n      \infamous\: \github:infamous/infamous@master\\n    }\n  }\n}\n```
with a simple rule: whatever is outside of the two dev/prod fields applies to both.
maybe for production, a simple `jspm build` would compile everything from `src` to `public`?
Maybe in production mode `jspm build` with no args automatically builds your `main` file into a bundle, and injects it into config.js of the baseURL.
similar to manually using `--inject`
It can be assumed that all the eps are in the dev baseURL, installed by jspm install. In the prod folder there wouldn\u2019t be any deps or source, just a single bundle.
`jspm build \u2014cached` or something could compile all modules into their own files in the prod baseURL, same structure as in the dev baseURL, and the app would load the deps using the depcache.
`jspm build-sfx` would be trickier because the html needs to be modified for it.
@guybedford I published the jspm workflow! https://npmjs.com/package/infamous
@guybedford Saw the updates to the rate limit error. That\u2019s an improvement. Still\u2026can you elaborate why jspm has this issue and bower doesn\u2019t? It would really be nice to eliminate the credentials thing altogether.
@EisenbergEffect there are two reasons:
1. In order for installs to happen quickly, we need to know the dependencies before the download has finished. That requires loading the package.json through the GitHub API in parallel to the download.\n2. When GitHub releases archives are provided, we should use them in place of the repo. This handles a lot of important scenarios like Bootstrap.
Is that because bootstrap packages up a \u201cbuilt\u201d version which is not just their repo?
And the only way to get the release archives is through the GitHub api?
yes exactly, the tarballs are 2.8MB per release otherwise
yes
the unauthenticated limit is 60
which is really low
what is the authenticated limit?
5000 per hour
which should always be within working limits
yeah, that shouldn\u2019t be an issue
also there is strong caching
I\u2019m mostly concerned with the \u201cgetting started\u201d story for jspm.
yeah so it doesn't force you to authenticate
but just when you hit the limits
Besides the unzip issue (which I saw you solved..yay!) the creds issue is one people seem to hit.
Hopefully now that the unzip issue is fixed we will see less people hitting the timeout on windows.
yeah the only issue now is people not having \git\ installed
I can see that being a problem with my community.
with all of these I think guiding users to the solution is the way to do it
Many of them are coming to JS and even open source for the first time...
so with the \git\ thing, I want to add a detection script that then informs to install git
Better error messages make a big difference yes.
etc - guiding to the solution
if there's better info we can provide for the GitHub auth process too let me know
tried to make it obvious as much as possible
@guybedford Why does git itself need to be installed?
It gives a very efficient cheap lookup function, which is the most common network call
https://github.com/jspm/github/blob/master/github.js#L247
The alternative is to use the API, but that is a bigger response object, and it is paged so requires multiple requests
https://developer.github.com/v3/git/refs/#get-all-references
which would slow down installs
also isn't rate limited
Note Bower also needs git installed
https://github.com/bower/bower/blob/master/lib/core/resolvers/GitResolver.js#L17
It would be interesting to see git lookup implemented directly in JS. 
It's theoretically possible, I guess
I think it\u2019s been done
Here it is..not sure if it\u2019s got what you need, but worth investigating: https://github.com/creationix/js-git
Yes, it may well be possible to use js-git
I'm trying to understand JSPM but I have a few problems. Does anyone have an example on how to configure a package that JSPM itself won't load due to an unsupported dependecy format?\n\nIf I understand the documentation at https://github.com/jspm/registry/wiki/Configuring-Packages-for-jspm correctly I can somehow override the problematic dependency (and other configuration).
jspm install github:some/dep -o \{ format: 'global' }\
is the sort of thing to do typically
it does take some work to configure existing packages
if you post an issue on the jspm registry repo (https://github.com/jspm/registry/) with the package and issue, happy to help look into it
This is a transitive dependency though.
mapbox-gl to be specific.
you can install like the above, with the exact version of the transitive dependency
to test out getting it to work
ok, I'm just heading out, but created an issue at https://github.com/jspm/registry/issues/106
will look into it soon, or you may be able to get help from others as well in the mean time
Thanks yet again. I'll try your suggestion now
it does require an understanding of the structure to work it out
it can be frustrating I know going through the variations trying to get it to work
Okay. I'll try to read the docs one last time :)
sure, you can ignore the \packages\ \configFile\ and \baseURL\ stuff for configuring packages
this will be moved to a separate section as soon as I get a chance
@trusktr I've separated the application configuration from the package configuration docs
into https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/wiki/Application-Package-Configuration
thanks for getting the docs for these started
@guybedford sweet.
I've also revised the configuration guide
please do let me know when you make suggestions, so I can check them too
hey folks, bit confused on a jspm thing. i set up a new project, been working fine for a while, but a couple of team members have recently started having issues
it appears that jspm install is clearing out my config file, which throws the the whole mess out of wack
perhaps i'm missing a step
@robwormald I\u2019ve decided to just not track the config.js file, and generate a new one each time after cloning. @guybedford says then I don\u2019t have version locking, but I guess I can just remove the ^ and ~ in package.json to lock version though (right?).
Add a second config file after config.js that jspm doesn\u2019t touch?
so i'm not going totally insane, right?
we do a bit of custom mapping, so that keeps getting nuked
@robwormald haha no, it\u2019s been a tricky ride here too. Please do make issues for all these concerns in the github.
But yeah, you can probably put custom mapping in a second file after config.js
Or before.
so i'm using the builder, so i wonder if i can load two config files..
Ah, good point.
I don\u2019t see why not.
I\u2019m not sure about the build-sfx, but just build, yeah.
Just put your build after the second config file.
e.g.\n```html\n<script src=\u201cconfig.js\></script>\n<script src=\u201ccustom-config.js\></script>\n<script src=\u201cbuild.js\></script>\n```
build-sfx :(
is what i'm using
Hmmm, yeah, seems like build-sfx would miss it.
If you could post a feature request on github asking for a way to specify multiple config files, that\u2019d be great!
for package.json, maybe `configFile` and `customConfigs` or something.
Or maybe just configFile and configFiles?
then build-sfx would know to use those.
@guybedford Is there a way to tell build-sfx to use extra config files?
@robwormald Just an idea, but for now, you might be able to write a script that injects the custom config into the build file.
But that\u2019s the sort of thing we\u2019d want to prevent from having to do.
the real issue here is that my custom map gets nuked
my project is 'foo-js' 
What does your config.js file look like?
i remap 'foo' to 'lib'
so i can reference import {Whatever} from 'foo/stuff/whatever'
All the source is in `foo`?
Have you tried puttting the map config in package.json?
jspm.map
```js\n{\n  \jspm\: {\n    \map\: {\n      \foo\: \./lib\\n    }\n  }\n}\n```
Or just\n\n```js\n{\n  \map\: {\n    \foo\: \./lib\\n  }\n}\n```\n\nat the root level.
It needs the `./` for local files.
just trying it now
Or\n\n```js\n{\n  \name\: \foo-js\\n  \jspm\: {\n    \map\: {\n      \foo\: \foo-js/lib\\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n
@robwormald ^
Without the `./`, then the first directory in the path is a package name.
closer
fixed my own lib stuff, now my remapped dep is blowing up
@robwormald specifically what type of changes have you been making to config.js that were getting clobbered? It would really help to know as individual config additions are supposed to be retained.
@robwormald the way to do this workflow is to use:
package.json\n```json\n{\n  \name\: \foo-js\\n  \directories\: {\n    \lib\: \lib\\n  },\n  \registry\: \jspm\\n}\n```
Then `jspm init` will add a path rule to your app for you
to allow
```javascript\n  require('foo-js/main') // -> loads lib/main.js\n```
it would still be good to catch the map config clobbering issue
if you have the steps to replicate
@robwormald I've updated the SystemJS builder configuration documentation in line with some of your questions as well - https://github.com/systemjs/builder#setting-configuration
(config does combine)
@guybedford is it possible to require/import the modules while on the node repl. awesome lib btw.
that is, modules installed with jspm
@vegetableman yes you can do this with
node
require('jspm').setPackagePath('/path/to/project')
or it will use the current folder
then
require('jspm').import('some/module')
you can also directly access from jspm CLI through
jspm run some/module
Thanks guy. it worked. Also, I have been trying to load mercury from systemjs/jspm. I am getting this error:-
```\n{ status_: -1,\n  value_:\n   { [Error: Error loading \npm:virtual-dom@0.0.24/virtual-hyperscript\ at file:/Users/viven/OpenSource/shazbot/jspm_packages/npm/virtual-dom@0.0.24/virtual-hyperscript.js\n   Error loading \npm:virtual-dom@0.0.24/virtual-hyperscript\ from \npm:mercury@12.0.0\ at file:/Users/viven/OpenSource/shazbot/jspm_packages/npm/mercury@12.0.0.js\n   ENOENT, open '/Users/viven/OpenSource/shazbot/jspm_packages/npm/virtual-dom@0.0.24/virtual-hyperscript.js']\n     errno: 34,\n     code: 'ENOENT',\n     path: '/Users/viven/OpenSource/shazbot/jspm_packages/npm/virtual-dom@0.0.24/virtual-hyperscript.js' },\n  onResolve_: undefined,\n  onReject_: undefined }\n```
That is, It's trying to load virtual-hyperscript.js which doesn't exist and is a folder within virtual dom
Let me know if I should file it as a github issue
@vegetableman sure I've created a jspm-npm issue to support this at https://github.com/jspm/npm/issues/38
Cool. I will try to find some info on it, may be, from browserify. Also, how do you go on about debugging systemjs? On the browser, debugging it through source map yields only undefined error. 
you mean in the SystemJS source itself?
The virtual dom thing is a relatively straightforward fix, I'll see if I can squeeze it in with this release, but I can't guarantee that
Ok. Could you give any pointer's on how to go about fixing it? I could send a PR.
It would basically be to glob all directories in the package here - https://github.com/jspm/npm/blob/master/npm.js#L458
and create a directoryname.js file containing module.exports = require('./directoryname/index.js')
sweet. thanks for sharing the link. i will look in to it. On the debugging part, I have debugging .src.js file which I guess is related to es6.
If that is system.src.js or es6-module-loader.src.js I know what you mean
yep. system.src.js.
sure, that's weighing up being production-ready v not
but I think the debugging support is more important, even if this is a bug between the minifier and the browser
created an issue at https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/issues/401
Thanks. Would be great if you could elaborate more about the issue created and the work involved? does it mean passing an option to jspm to switch it on/off?
Sure, happy to look into it soon so don't worry too much about it - but it would be always on, since any folder can be required directly in Node resolution
I suppose it only needs to apply when the folder itself contains an index.js
so it's checking that indicator I suppose
for that reason it can stick within the existing glob pattern I think
@guybedford hey, thanks so much for updating! 
@guybedford the two issues I ran into:
- i mapped /lib to /acme (so i could do import {Foo} from 'acme/bar/foo' everywhere)
- mapped a 3rd party dep (so i didnt have to do import {Bar} from 'bar/src/index')
both of which seemed to get clobbered
@robwormald yes this shouldn't happen unless those names clash with other names
@guybedford Is there any way to specify bundle for an entire folder like: `jspm bundle dist/*.* + other buld.js --inject`?
@ahmedshuhel no there isn't, perhaps you can use a script to do this manually with the builder API
https://github.com/systemjs/builder
I am sorry to bother you but could you please tell me where to start? 
https://github.com/systemjs/builder#setting-configuration
that is the basic pattern
Thank you so much I will let you know If I succeed. 
otherwise perhaps just generate a main module
bundle-modules.js
import './dist/first.js';\nimport './dist/second.js';\n...
and then bundle that
would be much easier
and you can have a script that generates the above
Yes that seems doable and much easier.
@guybedford I came up with this `gulp task`:\n```javascript\ngulp.task('build-src-index', function() {\n  var fs = require('fs');\n  var glob = require('glob');\n  var path = require('path');\n  var opt = {};\n\n  glob('dist/*.js', opt, function(er, files) {\n\n    var imports = files.map(function(f) {\n      var fileName = path.basename(f);\n      var ext = new RegExp(path.extname(fileName), 'g');\n      var moduleName = fileName.replace(ext, '');\n      return \import './\ + moduleName + \';\;\n    });\n\n    fs.writeFileSync(\n      './dist/build-index.js',\n      imports.join('\\n')\n    );\n  });\n\n});\n\ngulp.task('bundle', ['build-src-index'], function(cb) {\n  exec('jspm bundle dist/build-index + aurelia-bootstrapper build.js --inject', function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n    console.log(stdout);\n    console.log(stderr);\n    cb(err);\n  });\n});\n```\nIt seems to work. Thank you for the idea. But it would be much easier we could mention the `baseURL` of `config.js` to the `jspm bundle`.  Do you think it will be good feature for `jspm bundle`? 
typically one should aim to build around a single main entry point representing the app
there are cases where static parsing of dynamic System.import calls can be fed back into the bundling process
so would rather focus on that perspective and keep the features down for now
glad you got it working
The problem in my case is the `router` is dynamically loading the the files. The router is configured in the entry point `app.js` but there is no way jspm knows that. 
so if router contains `System.import` statements, then the plan is to support a \dynamic trace layer\
that can then do tiered bundling based on those dynamic imports as inputs
if it's `System.import('page/dashboard')`, then that can be traced and bundled automatically
variable names can't be though, so having custom inputs into a dynamic bundling process would be useful too
I am talking about Aurelia framework by @EisenbergEffect . I will go and study about `dynamic trace layer` and comeback again. Thank you.
@ahmedshuhel right, it doesn't exist currently, just where I'd like things to go
will discuss the ideas with Rob too
Great Thanks.
Wondering if anybody could give me some help learning how to configure jspm for a jquery plugin I'm playing with
The plugin in question is Lightbox2. It's github repo is here: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2
I'm using it to learn about jspm and jQuery plugins
So anyways, I've got the following in my package.json
```\n\jspm\: {\n    \dependencies\: {\n      ...\n      \lightbox2\: \github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1\\n    }\n  }\n```
Then this in my config.js
```\nSystem.config({\n  \github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1\: {\n    \main\: \js/lightbox\\n    \shim\: {\n      \format\: \global\\n      \deps\: [\n        \jquery\\n      ],\n      \exports\: \Lightbox\\n    }\n  }\n});\n```
Further down, I have this
```\nSystem.config({\n  \map\: {\n    \lightbox2\: \github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1\\n...\n```
But when I run `jspm install`, I keep getting this:\n```\nwarn No main entry point detected for github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1.\n     Try adding an override, or set the package.json \main\: false if this is the intention.\n\nok   Installed lightbox2 as github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1 (2.7.1)\n```
hey, you need to specifiy the override on install not in the config
jspm install lightbox2=github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1 -o override.json
where override.json contains the main, and shim as above
if that works, feel free to send a PR to the registry
(https://github.com/jspm/registry/)
I'll be back
Well, the install ran without errors. Let me see if I can import it
ugh, when I ran jspm install for my project it still gave me the error
yes, the override only works along with the install command
you need to check it into the registry to have this included by default
No way to have a local registry?
yes you can do that too
I've gotten it working, so I'll go work on creating a PR for the registry.
https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/wiki/Development-Workflows#creating-a-private-registry
thanks
that would be great
working on getting these docs better organized
So this jspm css black magic, could you point me to some docs on that?
B/c if I can get that working before I do the PR then that'd be nice
I see this tweet: https://twitter.com/kevinold/status/472373477216100353 
But can't find any info on how to go about it
also, gitter just continues to amaze me
@guybedford One thing that would be nice is the ability to bundle based on a glob. With Aurelia, much of the app (non-framework) code is dynamically imported by the templating engine. There\u2019s no way to trace source code and determine what those imports will be. So, the pattern we would like to have is to be able to just point the bundler at a folder and tell it to bundle everything in that folder, more or less. Glob is nicer, of course.
I've got the css module installed, but not sure how to set up the override.json and how to do the import call (I've tried both `import \lightbox2.css!\` and `import \lightbox.css!\`)
In both cases, I get a 404
override.json as it stands now:\n```javascript\n{\n  \main\: \js/lightbox\\n  \directories\ :{\n    \css\: \css\\n  },\n  \shim\: {\n    \format\: \global\\n    \deps\: [\n      \jquery\\n    ],\n    \exports\: \Lightbox\\n  }\n}\n```
ah, I figured it out!
`import \lightbox2/css/lightbox.css!\`
So that leaves a final question, do I need to keep the `directories` part of my override.json?
I'm guessing the answer is no
@EisenbergEffect sure, I can appreciate that
I've created https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/issues/404
`css` needs to be a dependency of the package
{
```javascript\n  \dependencies\: {\n    \css\: \0.1.0\\n  },\n  \shim\: \...\\n```

did gitter just mess up for you?
yup, seems to be my formatting somehow
I'm rerunning the install command using yours
Should I have expected that deps part to auto import the css?
yeah
if the path is right
I missed part of your change
trying it now
doesn't seem to be working
```javascript\nimport {Lightbox} from 'lightbox2';\n//import \lightbox2/css/lightbox.css!\\n```
I commented out the css import 
browser downloads the js, but the css isn't being requested
Ah
throwing errors before it gets to the css maybe
 Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined\nsystem.src.js:2159 Uncaught Error evaluating http://localhost:9000/jspm_packages/github/lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1/js/lightbox.js\nUncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
Adding `import {$} from 'jquery';` before the line to import lightbox2 fixes the jQuery is not defined
Not sure why it isn't autoloading jQuery though
but it still isn't loading the css.. isn't throwing off any errrors either
I wonder if it\u2019s Aurelia
I have some thoughts. We can discuss in private channel before reporting back here.
the report is in, doesn't look like it's Aurelia :-)
did you add jquery to \dependencies\ as well?
nope.. let's do that and see what happens
Should I be concerned that there are two requests for lightbox.js file?
no
```javascript\n{\n  \main\: \js/lightbox\\n  \dependencies\: {\n    \jquery\: \^2.1.3\\n    \css\: \0.1.0\\n  },\n  \shim\: {\n    \js/lightbox\: {\n      \format\: \global\\n      \deps\: [\n        \jquery\\n        \../css/lightbox.css!\\n      ],\n      \exports\: \Lightbox\\n    }\n  }\n}\n```
still isn't loading the css
or jQuery when I comment out that import statement
and 'js/lightbox.js\ is the right filename?
yes
and you're doing\njspm install github:lokesh/lightbox2 -o override.json
```\n Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined\nsystem.src.js:2159 Uncaught Error evaluating http://localhost:9000/jspm_packages/github/lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1/js/lightbox.js\nUncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined\n```
yes. though I've renamed the file to match what it will be named when I do the PR eventually
can you see the shim in the source
it should look like
\deps jquery\;\n\deps ../css/lightbox.css!\:\n\exports Lightbox\;
which source file?
http://localhost:9000/jspm_packages/github/lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1/js/lightbox.js
it doesn't have any of that
it does say `\format global\;` at the top
it sounds like the override isn't applying properly then
if there's already a format global that sounds like an old override somehow?
[lightbox2@2.7.1.json](https://files.gitter.im/jspm/jspm/AslO/lightbox2_2.7.1.json)
I mean try deleting jspm_packages
and running again
or doing install -f
which is the same thing effectively
real quick, have a look at my config.js and package.json and make sure I'm not screwing that up
I can't look into it more now, but maybe in half an hour
that's fine, this isn't time pressing

`lightbox.js` in `jspm_packages/github/lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1/js` starts with \n```javascript\n/* */ \n\format global\;\n/**\n```
I got to this point by deleting `jspm_packages` and only running `jspm install lightbox2=github:lokesh/lightbox2@2.7.1 -o lightbox2\\@2.7.1.json`
@AshleyGrant this is going to be something silly messing up
I'd advise rechecking some simple things
like you have the right override file
and you're installing into the right jspm_packages folder etc
I just ran a test here and it's definitely working fine
Note the `format` part doesn't do anything in `shim`
So it should really be
```json\n{\n  \main\: \js/lightbox\\n  \dependencies\: {\n    \jquery\: \^2.1.3\\n    \css\: \0.1.0\\n  },\n  \format\: \global\\n  \shim\: {\n    \js/lightbox\: {\n      \deps\: [\n        \jquery\\n        \../css/lightbox.css!\\n      ],\n      \exports\: \Lightbox\\n    }\n  }\n}\n```
but that doesn't affect it
Yeah, that's why I deleted the jspm_packages folder and only ran that single jspm install
I didn't install the rest of my stuff
just wanted to see the output of simply that
are you running in Windows?
yes
this may have been something I fixed today
ok
that would explain it
need to update jspm?
I need to do the release
https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli/commit/6f49d8237df2e8cdba0a83ae8db6740f43cecd40
alright, let me know when you do the release and I'll update
and rerun
will be at some point in the next 12 hours
maybe I can update my jspm install w/that line
that should work too
it's just that one thing
Yep, adding that fixed the issue with the CSS not loading.
though now it's complain about Lightbox not being defined.. grrr
this is the painful part of jspm - working out these interops
once it's done please do send a registry PR
Yeah, I'm fine figuring this out though
it means the person who comes after you can get lightbox to work on first install
I'm doing this so we have a recipe for the aurelia docs
ok great
B/c we know people are going to want to use jQuery plugins
And we'd like to have a 'preferred' way to do this
and hell, it makes me learn JSPM
ok, yeah it's a pretty standard process
plugins pretty much do all look the same
note you can leave out the \exports\ thing
and jspm will auto-detect it
but good to have it there too
let me try doing that and see if it fixes this issue
see https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/wiki/Module-Format-Support#globals-global
https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/wiki/Meta-Configuration
that's whats happening in SystemJS
if you're interested
Well I'll be damned
taking out the exports thing fixed it
may be case?
maybe.. the casing was the same though
unless it is definining asynchronously
worth checking jspm has the right global returned from import
even if global is there
how would I do that?
System.import('lightbox').then(console.log.bind(console))
http://i.imgur.com/YBougx6.png
I took out the import statement and pasted what you said in to the constructor for the viewmodel
`System.import('lightbox2').then(console.log.bind(console));`
right, does it definitely have a \format global\ at the top?
```\n/* */ \n\format global\;\n\deps jquery\;\n\deps ../css/lightbox.css!\;\n/**\n```
(the above is a global written by Lightbox, so thats why you need exports to get the right thing)
if exports is not working and the name matches directly
I'd be very surprised
I deleted the lokesh folder before I ran jspm install w/the override, so what you see there is the latest thing created with the updated override json
yeah that's right
the global is right
I have no idea about that __origin__thing though
`__origin__`
`window.__origin__` is being set somehow
That's coming from aurelia, I believe
That's coming from Aurelia.
It shouldn\u2019t set that on window though
That\u2019s probably a bug on our end
it would be worth checking it is on the window
This is what Aurelia does internally. Could that be conflicting?\n```javascript\nvar originalInstantiate = System.instantiate.bind(System);\n\nSystem.instantiate = function (load) {\n  return originalInstantiate(load).then(function (m) {\n    var execute = m.execute;\n\n    m.execute = function () {\n      var executed = execute.apply(m, arguments), key, exportedValue;\n      var target = executed;\n\n      if(target.__useDefault){\n        target = target['default'];\n      }\n\n      if(target === window){\n        return executed;\n      }\n\n      if(!Object.isFrozen(target)){\n        Origin.set(target, new Origin(load.name, 'default'));\n      }\n      \n      for (key in target) {\n        exportedValue = target[key];\n\n        if (typeof exportedValue === \function\) {\n          Origin.set(exportedValue, new Origin(load.name, key));\n        }\n      }\n\n      return executed;\n    };\n\n    return m;\n  });\n};\n```
perhaps change to `execute.apply(this, arguments)` to maintain the binding
it doesn't look like it's on window
I'm gonna go ahead and create the PR for this override
sure, I can test it too
cool
done
#1008 <\u2014 does it link to issues?
YES!!!
Andrew, if you\u2019d be interested
we were going to do a google hangouts
voice chat
For Wreqr chat?
for inspiration
sam saccone will be here in 30 mins
I can\u2019t do Wreqr chat today :(
if you\u2019d like to be a part of it we can reschedule.
i\u2019d like for you to be there!
If you could maybe do a **short** summary of things you talk about/decide and I\u2019ll review??
that sounds like a plan
ha who is @mydigitalself 
that\u2019s Mike Bartlett
hey @mydigitalself 
He\u2019s from UK, South Africa and Australia :/
i\u2019m only from 2 continents :(
i am from ohio
it is in america
@cobbweb,
can you still not talk wreqr?
@jmeas 
Nope, at work
lol work
\u2026so?
i did that today
Don\u2019t have my laptop
wait, @cobbweb you don't have a computer? What do you do, manual labor?
a magnent 
and a harddrive
magnet*
Haha
Yep, what Sam said
a needle in a binary haystack. i like it
do you guys want to
I have a work iMac in the middle of the office
have this hangout?
i'm ready
Unofficial practice is to leave the office for calls
are you guys still there?
No
NOT YOU
ur missing out cobbweb
https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/commit/85f07c105543c125966eb8fcb617c230f304eb2b
the changelog
is this ok?
Worth mentioned the module test refactor?
ah good call
Was expecting it to be under modules :facepunch: 
welcome to core @jasonLaster 
welcome @jasonLaster!
bad choice
@jmeas I agree
oh, hi guys, just popped in earlier to see how you were getting along with Gitter. shout if you need anything, we're **huge** fans and users of marionette btw.
Thanks @mydigitalself. I'm a big fan of gitter, love the [work](https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open) you're doing. How are you finding marionette, what are you using it for?\n\n
@suprememoocow is best to tell you, but pretty much every live collection and filtered collection we used it based off marionette. 
cool - invite him over here. Would love to chat with him about it.
will do, he should see the @ mention and i'm sure he'll pop in. 
btw did you intentionally markup \work\ to be a hyperlink to our issue list in your earlier message?
haha - great. Didn't want to assume @ mentions wee gitter global :)
yup - was actually, initially looking to to do a code reading of gitter, but couldn't find it.
ah cool, was just making sure the markdown parser hadn't gone crazy
now that i know you have a public issue tracker, you won't be able to ditch me.
oh cool. hey there @mydigitalself :)
I\u2019m really enjoying Gitter.
Hey guys, Andrew from Gitter here. So glad to see that you're using our product. We're using yours extensively. There are a few bits we would love to contribute back at some stage.
For instance, we've got a nifty mixin for CollectionViews and CompositeViews which ensures that items inserted into the collection view always maintain the collection order. Might be something that could be useful?
suprememoocow, that sounds really useful. care to make an issue about it?
Hey @samccone, what was the issue with behaviors?
haven\u2019t been around, sorry!
will be around tomorrw
Is it still Sunday over there?
If anyone has some time. It'd be great to get a second set of eyes on these tests: #1038. 
this is bad
https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/commit/38d03f7d59630d9497b7530fe257d5479716283f
per https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/issues/1041
so it find the method...
if it is on the view
https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/src/marionette.view.js#L150
https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/blob/66d57adb51f1f1a7a29f3d18ac6e820e3abb0d3e/backbone.js#L1119
i think i know the solution 
i will have to transform the key
into the function ref
it actually should not be that hard
hahahah not sure why i did not catch this before
but not that bad all considering 
actually, yea. that isn't that bad as long as the function is passed in
which is kinda what @jmca was saying...
and how i have always used it 
i do not like the key lookup crap
i think it is ugly
but we need to support it 
this is reminding me how ugly this method is: [behaviorEvents](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/src/marionette.behaviors.js#L78-L97) is. So many temporary vars.
it is legit the most complicated of all of this
by 10x
i like the \add trailing whitespace\ hack
but also why it is so magical
that was such an ahah moment
it is so cooool
that no one will ever appreciate :-1: 
fixed it
i get all the points
haha - i think they might. 
awhile back, I had something like this - https://gist.github.com/jasonLaster/9733446
just for the joy of refactoring, i decided to pass on it cause I wanted to get the invoke thing in and eat lunch.
your fix looks good.
you are abstracting the logic into the helper method
putting compile on the behavior...
think you could make two temporary vars, key and behaviorFunction?
i could
there's too much on that line\n\n```js\nvar behaviorKey = key + whitespace;\nvar behaviorFunction =  _.isFunction(behaviorEvents[key]) ? behaviorEvents[key] : b[behaviorEvents[key]];\n_events[behaviorKey] = behaviorFunction;\n```
haha - or you could leave it :)
it is long
ill tweak it
behaviorKey
is not even right
it should be like newBehaviorKey
which is gross
eventKey ???
are you ok with behaviorFn
also considered behaviorFunc haha
actually, maybe eventHandler?
that way its eventKey, eventHandler?
i am going to add another commit on top of this
like a general refactor
you already have plenty of context that we're talking behavior
handler?
that'd work
behavior.compileEvents?
that could be for another day too... don't really care
i do not think reduce per line 85
or _.object
makes things any better
yea, that's less important 
array => object
is not very pretty
no matter how you do it
agreed
heading out. good work hunting this down / supporting your baby :)
Should we be putting whitespace fixes into separate commits?
Like this https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/1038/files#diff-11b4741dfb2188a360c0d860b4647702L25
Yea, that's something I do when I see it. I'm not sure if making people `git rebase -i` edit is worth it.   
I usually don\u2019t make any effort to keep it separate.
Hey @samccone, kinda confused by your comment? I'm probably being slow
seems like you got it :)
yup, think that guys good. Such a great example of tests as documentation.
we just need to figure out a way to get google to crawl the docs
hey @mydigitalself nodewebkit app of this app?
yea, that'll be great
there\u2019s a mac app, which is effectively the same thing, are you guys on Macs?
@samccone, did you see the travis fail for the  behaviors fix?
oh snap
where can i get that @mydigitalself 
https://gitter.im/apps
the mac app is great :)
![](http://dogesay.com/wow.png)
you guys on the special sauce ;)
ha @mydigitalself how big is your guys staff? 
do you guys have funding? or are you bootstraped 
@jasonLaster i kicked the build to re go
cool, I'm going to pull 1.7.x into Etsy when that change goes out.
going to do a release in like 5 min
i put it on my app this weekend http://edit.sx/
works fine
by the way, going to start pulling some of dmytro's work into 1.8. It's really solid
sure sure that is fine
we can start merging
i\u2019m going to mark some issues that i\u2019ll be doing.
in the next few days, for 1.8.
would rather have that out in < 2 weeks
i read that as edit, south by south west. 
what does edit.sx do?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENakxbtAUQU 
@samccone just 4 of us, funded via Index, we\u2019re about to start hiring again, looking for another 2 guys.
looks neat, @samccone 
in the video, the edits are rearranging the images and adjusting the \u2018rank\u2019 (colored dots)
would it also support, say, replacing the image?
i\u2019m thinking of a PSD being sent, then an edit to the PSD being made, and shared back.
 yeah that would be cool
i am adding comment and stuff
this week
something is borked https://travis-ci.org/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/builds/21399899
i\u2019m not sure if you use droplr / cloudup
just hanging
works locally
but that\u2019s what we use here, and it\u2019s pretty awesome
oh weird
yup, reminds me of cloud app too
ok it is passing now
https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/1043
going to do a release then
this look ok https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/commit/b71b7e0679e31889975eeb1e8d78357e8540bdbc#diff-42ba1d994f4fa8c6ad17a7efae7936cc
looks fine, the only thing i\u2019d comment on is the creation of `var eventKey`
it\u2019s only used once, 2 lines below
so i\u2019d prob just do
yeah @jasonLaster and I talked about this last night
`_events[key + whitespace]`
simplify the code
make it more readable 
going to release it then
oh nice github!
they fixed that crap
so we autoclose the issues
ok it is out
gonna be pulling 1.7 into this app i\u2019m building today hopefully
i bet we are going to be > 4700 by end of the week
hey did we want to try another hacker news push?
maybe tomorrow at 9am.
this is based off a link someone posted in IRC
that suggested 9am has the greatest likelihood of reaching the home page
how many of these are ready? https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/issues?milestone=6&state=open
all alone :alien: 
so, dmytro's should be good: https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pulls/dmytroyarmak
cool
@jasonLaster if you wanted to you can start the merging into 1.8
everyone is fine with that
also it looks like github now closes the PR
when we do an upstream rebase
but you can still close for sanitiy 
sounds good. happy to do it this afternoon.
hi can you guys vote for me k thx
http://energychallenge.energy.gov/a/dtd/Home-Energy-Hunt/57324-26122
for all the code reviewz
how do i downvote
show i like this form. Register asks for an email and name. Login asks for email and password. 
yeah it is busted
this is like voter suppression. how do i add a password?
they must know you're a popcorn time supporter.
hahaha why
mm feels good
getting crap off of my plate
saying no to people 
@jmeas you coming up this week?
it would be next week
still working out the details
i should know by tomorrow
& going to email chris about it
How did the Wreqr chat go?
I\u2019ve noticed in our GitHub releases we don\u2019t pre-fix the title with the version anymore\u2026 any reason for this change?
that\u2019s a q. for @samccone.
the wreqr chat went fine. conclusions:
1. we will add channels to core
2. we need to figure out the new naming for the API
it\u2019s undecided whether we will add analagous
listenTo things for reqres/commands
like how you added that
commandFor method, i think
we\u2019re not sure about those\u2026but if we decide on names for them now
then we can add them in 2.1
or if you want to argue in their favor
Sounds good
i\u2019m not against them or anything, i\u2019m just not sure if it makes sense
Yea, I\u2019m not totally sold on adding them to the core
have any of you ever passed options into an application?
or extended an application?
Yea I\u2019ve extended application
interesting. what was the use case?
To mixin my module system instead of Marionette.Module
makes sense
mixin not the right word... but yea
This guy if you haven\u2019t seen, mostly a ripoff of Marionette.Module but with a few personal tweaks (namely module args)
https://github.com/cobbweb/ocky
oh yeah, i remember seeing this months ago
when there was all that talk about modules
I want to add back in the module argu introspection that angular has
this looks as bad as it did back then
It\u2019s pretty neat
is there anything that ocky does these days
that marionette modules don\u2019t do?
Grrr README typos
Yea it\u2019s mainly the arguments
what\u2019s the difference?
The module definition function is only given one arg (the module itself)\u2026 then the rest are custom
makes sense
that is how marionette should be imo
It will receive 6 parameters, in this order:\n\nThe module itself\nThe Application object\nBackbone\nBackbone.Marionette\njQuery\nUnderscore\nAny custom arguments\n
^^ That\u2019s what marionette module does
Ocky it just:\n\nIt will receive 2 parameters, in this order:\n\nThe module itself\nAny custom arguments\n
nice edit
you edited it before i made a joke
\\#edittooquickly
##### jmeas pls
## jmeaspls
#JMEAS PLS OK
\\e\\s\\c\\a\\p\\e\\ \\a\\l\\l\\ \\t\\h\\e\\ \\t\\h\\i\\n\\g\\s
```js\nundefined = function() { return window; };\n```
^^ You just broke the internet
Except ocky, it doesn\u2019t use `undefined`
void???
nope, nothin'
anyway, i\u2019d like to remove those arguments.
DB made a case for them
but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough to keep it in core
Not sure if you can do this with Marionette.Module\u2026 but in Ocky you can just instantiate a new module like `var Namespace = new Ocky(\u2018Namespace\u2019)`\u2026 and then add submodules off that
good question
i\u2019m doing like
var ModuleClass = Marionette.Module.extend({  });
well
i guess it\u2019s different, nvm
I have a weak feeling that Marionette.Module requires to be built via Marionette.Application
i think you\u2019re right
but maybe not
marionette\u2019s module method
very quickly passes it off to the module\u2019s create function
but i guess the module itself won\u2019t call create on itself
Marionette.Module seems to have a lot more code than Ocky but not much more in terms of features :/
Ocky doesn\u2019t have initializers/finalizers
Did you get a chance to look at this? https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine/pull/118
Module's are special
I got stumped twice today, once was with `app.module('Foo', ModuleClass)` not working in an older version. The other time with a sub-module being created in its parent's onStart function, which is probably a bad idea :)
@cobbweb what's Ocky?
I wonder if we can ditch Marionette.Module in v2 and tell peeps to use ES6 modules???
@jasonLaster Miminal Marionette.Module ripoff
Where do I find it? 
https://github.com/cobbweb/ocky
makese sens :)
Main difference is the module definition parameters
Marionette.Module will receive 6 parameters, in this order:\n\nThe module itself\nThe Application object\nBackbone\nBackbone.Marionette\njQuery\nUnderscore\nAny custom arguments
@cobbweb per the release titles
i duno
Ocky will receive 1 parameter, in this order:\n\nThe module itself\nAny custom arguments
@samccone I think it was better with the version numbers in there TBH
yea, Ocky makes sense
yeah ok
it was not on purpose
just me not havine a way
aka not being aware there ever was a way
haha no probs
so, when's it nice to receive $, _? 
Just use the globals or pass them into your module as custom args
No minify advantage, only thing is slightly slower lookup speeds
https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/issues/375
nice find @jmeas 
@jmeas I think that issue inspired me to make Ocky
that issue is inspiring me to make marionette v2
where they are removed
I wonder if we can ditch Marionette.Module in v2 and tell peeps to use ES6 modules???
Haven\u2019t looked at ES6 modules\u2026 just a thought
i\u2019m not sure
i think...
for v2
we should support multiple apps
running at the same time
i will file an issue
i\u2019m not opposed to it. i\u2019d want to know more about the reason behind it
one thing that @jasonLaster mentioned, that i think would be a great idea
is a module / sub module distinction.
often our highest-level modules have more power than the sub modules
@jmeas Not for me
yeah, probably not for everyone. but it\u2019s useful for some folks, i think.
also maybe a module / component distinction. although, this is also blurry
heh, yeah.
i\u2019d like to see that one day...
eh i think we need to think on features 
for v2
to make marionette better at building larger apps
faster to start with
halfway to 1.8!
based on current issues.
pushed the last dmytro branch without a rebase from master...
careless: https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/compare/v1.8.0
is a force push to clean that up cool? 
yes
lolz https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/1025
2.x
not 1.8
Is it really?
yeah
it is breaking
yeah, that is totally breaking. good point
will take that out of 1.8
i could amend the commit that added the region docs
and say it throws an error when it isn\u2019t defined
Do we document you can use a region without an el?
then it won\u2019t be breaking!!!
well we do not document it @cobbweb 
i think it will cause peoples code to break
just like onDomRefresh did
when we ensured the element was actually in the DOM
someone complained about it today :(
i think the fact we don\u2019t have anything documented sort of defaults to it being the case that it isn\u2019t necessary
like any other option, i guess.
I\u2019m only partial to this, but given it\u2019s not documented that you can use a Region without an el; is this semantically a breaking change?\u2026 or just might break for people misusing Region?
yea, i think this meets the definition of \changing behavior\ even if it's behavior that should be avoided
Just playing devils advocate
yea, being cautious.
so where should it go?
v2!
there's a v2.0.0-dev...
ha, that much i gathered
i think i might have merged something in v2 dev
a long ass time ago
yeah, i think v2 dev is the way to go\u2026even though it is 180 commits behind master
but i did not close the issue
just rebase it
yes it was that long ago
180 commits ago
i was still a boy
now i am a man
yea, its really old. actually doesn't even rebase...
WARNING THIS IS BEFORE REBASE WAS INVENTED 
back when the code was emailed between the maintainers
binary images. bc they make sense
i love getting emails
of people paying me for software
Do you get these ones? https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=lxzGSPwvAJo-exZyC5ySvi__vLKFAchSUtHu0f4aayCFV72F4xXk_GKZZYu&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d8cdcf517b037b45005cf5d4eda3b985b
Linked from the site
i want to take that crap off
I agree
but\u2026 it is his call
i do not want to be a dick
what is it?
I bought stickers the other week
I should put them on my laptop
really?
me too @cobbweb!
2 weeks ago :)
i did not want to waste my money
js swag up in this piece!!!
awww yeah
(coming from the kid with a realworld dogecoin)
https://shibemint.com/
> is going to steal sam\u2019s dogecoin
haha - this coin requires breaking and entering
@jmeas http://i.imgur.com/wGUYAPM.jpg
so master doesn't rebase cleanly onto v.2.0.0-dev...
kind of surprising given that it should only have one commit ontop to apply, but also not surprising given it's age
@jasonLaster, what\u2019s the current state of v1.8.0?
github says it\u2019s 2 ahead, 0 behind. is that just a mistake?
@jmeas I took the throwError commit off. 
would anyone object to cherry-picking this [guy](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/commit/48eea25bc8e8661cfd3c21ed27c060afd49c6ae9) and blowing up v.2.0.0-dev and starting off of v.1.8.0?
not i
i kind of prefer that, so that it\u2019s after all of the latest 1.x stuff really.
though i guess that doesn\u2019t really matter
actually, @cobbweb it looks like your bower_components change is in 1.x already... 
Which change was that?
so, is there anything of value in v.2.0.0-dev or is it just a heaping pile of shit?
I think we should scrap it and start fresh IMO
https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/commit/85fd1e72
doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s anything there
RESET \u2014HARD
I we need to get keep on top of things that go into v1 that should also get merged into v2
And make sure it never lags behind
merge and merge often
shouldn\u2019t be too tough.
i think 2.x should happen after 1.8.
1.9 => 2.1
i also think some things should be moved to v3, like restructuring models, and maybe collection/composite views
anyone object to changing v.2.0.0-dev => v2.0?
not i
Nope
I was gonna suggest that
do you guys see something wrong with this
  edits = new App.Collections.Edits\n  App.reqres.setHandler 'edits', -> edits\n
yes
edits = App.request('edits\u2019)
Yes, it\u2019s CoffeeScript :P
edits.fetch()
i have no idea how to read coffeescript
so i have no idea
What @jmeas said
so then\u2026 when i call app.request(\u2018edits\u2019) i would expect it to have stuff
is `-> edits` returning edit
yes
i must be missing something...
like why is fetch
learn 2 use wreqr
not mutating the edits object in wreqr 
is this a public repo?
this is very strange 
are we ie8+???
pro tip
hardlinks
reload the page
var charAtZero = string[0];
are you okay, sam? :(
oh sh
i think i just figured out a way to do something magical
with behaviors
you guys will LOVE THIS
you just set the bar really high
    events: ->\n      \click a[v-href]\: @routeTrigger
    routeTrigger: (e) ->\n      App.Router.navigate $(e.currentTarget).attr('v-href'), trigger: 1\n
  a.btn.back(v-href=\dashboard\) Dashboard\n  a.btn.share-edit(v-href=\editor/#{objectId}\) Share Edit\n
pretty cool
i think
same, is that jade?
duh
man, you get all the cool toys
on my own projects
yes
i choose my own stack
stylus, jade, coffeescript
precompiled jade templates
the jade parser/compiler is a mind fuck
yea, guess that goes without saying. 
samccone, that is cool, though.
https://github.com/carrot/roots-client-templates/blob/master/lib/index.coffee
i have significant experience with it
i like that a lot actually
i mean, it only saves a bit of code
in every single view
this is a behavior
so awesome
yea, i like this too. what are you calling it, **Navigable**?
maybe
i will package it up in a moment
just finishing this bit o code
i <3 behaviors
i\u2019m surprised marionette has gone so long without them
I'm glad we didn't merge `extendClassName` haha
I spent so many cycles thinking about inheritance vs. mixins
what do you guys think the behavior here should be:
https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/issues/1033
https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/937
when the user specifies an @ thing
that doesn\u2019t exist
@ui.iDontExist
ignore it
i think there is a bug in reqres
please elaborate!
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/47552986/Screenshots/n5.png
config.content is undefined
is that wreqr 1.0?
ya
app.reqres.setHandler(\u2018lala\u2019, function() {}, this);
is that what you\u2019re missing?
you pass in the context
oh i fixed it
i was derping around
i was setting app.reqres.setHandler \u2018foo\u2019, {}
we should really not bomb
aka just handle it
and return the flat value\u2026.
i wrote a wrapper for reqres
that does that
PR that
it does a lot more than just that
but that\u2019s one component of it
because reqres and commands use the same shit
that might be tough, but maybe not
https://github.com/Puppets/future-vars.js
future vars ftw
i\u2019m so dumb
i just made that PR against master
i can never remember!
https://github.com/samccone/marionette-behaviors#viewlinks
That's awesome @samccone. Really excited about this: https://github.com/samccone/marionette-behaviors
this is going to have so many
i just actively refactor them out
@jasonLaster will be interested in what you end up with
@jmeas #1046 is legit.
how many devs are you going to be switching over
actually, jmeas do you want to get the container with the ui replacement or the selector?
the container, right?
can someone explain the advantage of this
that\u2019s what the original code ultimately ends up with. a jquery object.
now that i see it...
i am not sure
the reason we added ui interpolation was the DRY up selectors 
i think that\u2019s the same idea here.
so\u2026  you think someone would already have ui element for the itemViewContainer? 
and also want to append to it?
for those that don\u2019t, this might give them reason to add it to the ui hash.
to bring all of their selectors together.
well, MeoMix\u2019s example made me support this
but now that i think about it
what\u2019s he doing with that container?
yea, his comments imply that he has it in both places. He very well could be doing something evil.
he could also be using it to conditionally add a styling class in certain conditions
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/47552986/Screenshots/n6.png
probably not a big deal either way.
@jmeas, was thinking that this.ui could be unbound, at that point `this.ui[...]` would be a selector.
not sure if you want to cover that case
@samccone extreme?
good point, @jasonLaster. I guess I\u2019m being a bit presumptuous in thinking that the
ui would be bound at that point.
but, if you\u2019re rendering before binding the ui hash...
what are you doin'
yea, bindUI should be part of render... was thinking anything could happen
i see what you\u2019re saying, but for some reason it doesn\u2019t strike me as that big a deal.
meomix has a good argument for that PR, i think.
i am so sleepy
i was just staring at this code
wondering why this callback for the AppRouter routing wasn\u2019t firing
it looked fine
i had set it as onShow
instead of onRoute
81 issues after 1.8
i\u2019d like to see us get to 20-30 issues at some point :)
https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/801 has a swap method in it too
Which I don\u2019t think is breaking
I think I asked @ccamarat to split it but he never got around to it
yeah i\u2019d like to see that in 1.x
i closed that?
Yep
You did
i can\u2019t reopen it
it was against 2.0.0-dev
And that got removed/renamed?
i unpublished it just then
You also closed #1012 and #1002
Silly Github
if i republish it
i guess you wouldn\u2019t know this
i wonder if it reopens them
probably no
should we ask them to open new PRs against the new branch, @cobbweb?
Yea I think so\u2026 and get @ccamarat to split his close/destory and swap code
Or you could just do them manually
gonna do that in the AM, gonna pass out
yeah i guess that\u2019s an option as well
Would be nice if we had API docs yea?
Just having a look at [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) 
we have docs?
in dash
i mean we do!
well, that's cool
oh man, how do you guys live without dash!
this is my favorite application on the planet.
hey @cobbweb @jmeas @jasonLaster before we merge I think we should get :thumbsup: for 2 people on core
on any functional code change
@samccone, I like that idea.
just to prevent derps
that was kind of my rule of thumb, but I like it being, you know, spoken outloud.
good thinking. I was thinking something similar as well.
lol you guys are going crazy
on github
RACE TO THE BOTTOM
heh, what do you mean?
@jmeas why? https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/1002#issuecomment-38563710
you can just merge it manually
that\u2019s fine
i just didn\u2019t want to forget about it
since it\u2019s closed
i may forget about it
then reopen?
the branch has been unpublished
did not know that happens
me neither
here 1 second
so when i unpublished it
i closed 3 good PRs
so many merge conflicts
ok https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/1053
oh, that's crazy
yea, so @dmytroyarmak closed all of his PRs and opened new ones...
why?
because
i\u2019m cool with this: https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/1012#issuecomment-38564736
or at least letting ahumphreys take over
wtf is up with travis
@samccone, I'm thinking `scrollTo` collection behavior. We're going to be doing something similar to MeoMix's example in our app
context @jasonLaster ?
https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/issues/1033#issuecomment-38527665
I see this and think:\n\n```js\nserializeData: function() {\n    return _.extend({}, this.model.toJSON(), {\n        'has_cost': this.model.get('cost') > 0\n    })\n}\n```\n\nand think that `renderData` makes more sense\n\n```js\nrenderData: function() {\n\tvar data = {};\n\n\tif (_.isFunction(this.beforeRenderData)) {\n\t\tdata = this.beforeRenderData(data);\n\t}\n\n\tvar data = this.serializeData();\n\n\tif (_.isFunction(this.afterRenderData)) {\n\t\tdata = this.afterRenderData(data);\n\t}\n\n\treturn data;\n}\n```\n\nDisclaimer: `renderData` is probably a bad name. 
toJSON
this is all supposed to be on the model
not in your view
in a perfect world
we should post to hacker news again
not sure my views are one to one with models. might be doing it wrong
do it!
can one of you do it?
i can not post it again

alright, going up

is there a delay
to my upvote being processed?
or do i need more rep to upvote or something
ha - probably a caching thing.
why 0 points
:-1: I see \1 point\
behaviors just aren\u2019t as interesting to the rest of the world
@jmeas did you upvotez
YES
i mean
i pushed the little arrow
and got no feedback that it actually worked
shit -  \This coffee company just got $46M in VC money (slate.com)\
HN is going to ADD over this all day, and ignore behaviors
this is dumb
i wantto punch the internet
marionette will be popular in due time
we just need not-terrible documentation
and examples and recipes and things
i think wording like
or something
sounds more catch
\u2018Native Backbone Mixins now a part of Marionette'
maybe not native, but, you know, something along those lines.
yea, Behaviors will get out there in due time. I could see blogs like `http://dailyjs.com/`, or `http://thechangelog.com/` being intrested in something like this
yeah good call
i just want to get some buzz about mariontte
sure, but then there'd be more annoying questions in the #marionette...
so many more
yea, I'm continually impressed by the community and diversity of the conversation, prs, issues, etc... it'd be great to grow this thing
so, i think this got lost in the thread:\n\nwhat do you think of something like this?\n`module = new ModuleClass(moduleName, app, parent, options);` vs `module = new ModuleClass(moduleName, app, options);`\n\nor it's non-breaking, but uglier twin:` module = new ModuleClass(moduleName, app, options, paret);`
looks fine to me
i\u2019d prefer the first
yea, `module = new ModuleClass(moduleName, app, parent, options);` this guy is the 2.0 change :)
modules make me sad
sooo disorganized
yea, it's a drama :/
i was thinking about `Marionette.Namespaces` being a thing on the train today
I'm lets be honest, that's what DB was thinking about... 
too many globals, lets namespace them. 
and all of those anonymous function module users
that\u2019s all that\u2019s happening there
do you think they use controllers in the way we use modules?
like as a place to catch events and call methods?
i\u2019d guess so
by the way, haven't forgotten about this guy - https://github.com/jmeas/marionette-recipes/tree/master/experimental/puppets
hah, no rush
just some silly ideas...
that's why it's great.
anyways, will be pairing for the forseeable future. will find you after that
talk to you lata'
hey, what do you guys think the demand would be like for screencasts on testing single page apps?
on testing them?
integration tests
how to
i think so
man @samccone 
i really wish reqres accepted static values
maybe i\u2019ll add that tonight
v2.2
or at least bitched at you
to tell you everything will die
reqres/commands should not use the same API so directly
it needs to really be refactored
doesn\u2019t seem like you can use bind on reqres.request
_.bind( globalCh.reqres.request, globalCh.reqres );
unless something is wrong there
i was being dumb
hey does anyone have a nice solution for this https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/1054#issuecomment-38604174
i am notsure i have a super nice one
@samccone, what's the question - how to do to`HaveBeenCalledOn`? 
I did this in module spec for jasmine: `expect(defineSpy.mostRecentCall.object).toBe(module);`
something like this might be nice going forward: [jasmine-sinon](https://github.com/froots/jasmine-sinon). I think @cobbweb has better thoughts around this though.
By the way, we're adding a HotKeys behavior at work today. We're also adding transitions between two layouts in marionette regions w/ css3 animations. Today's shaping out to be a great day :)
how was it been?
@jasonLaster 
HotKeys is just getting started. Basically views have a keyEvents property and hotKeys behavior and everything works.\n\n```js\nkeyEvents: {\n   'ctrl a, shift b': 'closeSidebar'\n}\n```\n
another guy is running with it. 
i like that a lot
@mydigitalself gitter app is eating up 25% of my CPU
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36928599/Screenshots/07l.png
that\u2019s not good
mine\u2019s at 1.2%
are you guys using nodewebkit?
15% here
nope, it\u2019s effectively embedded Safari. what machines/osx vers are you on?
now down to 2%, but it\u2019s a bit erratic
macbook pro 2013, latest osx
10.9.2
mbpr?
yes
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36928599/Screenshots/07m.png
identical to mine
@mydigitalself if you OS it
you would get free debugging
we could easily do that, although there\u2019s not a lot to it. will chat to @suprememoocow about it and keep an eye on it
were you in this chat or another chat when it was racing high?
this one
k, so no bucketloads of animated gifs to send safari\u2019s renderer hot. thanks for letting me know, will look into it. would you mind keeping an eye on it yourself please?
filed as https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter/issues/191
got to run to dinner, cya round and thanks again for letting me know
nom nom dinner time
gonna write docs tonight
or maybe i\u2019ll update wreqr
taking suggestions
so now thatwe have all this v2 and v1.8 stuff
haha what is the plan
i think < 2 weeks timeframe for v1.8 is reasonabe
once i do the spaced events
there will be 1 last thing to do
preventing composite views from rendering twice; #640
Yea, i don't think #640 will be bad. I'm thinking it just requires making an informed decision on how we want to handle it.
had a feeling this might happen https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/pull/1054#issuecomment-38617622
same, @jasonLaster. I haven\u2019t thought much about the issue.
We should decide if we want to make proxying bindEntityEvents and getOption a breaking change or not. If not, I'd say that could be done by 1.8 as well
1.7.2 
coming out soon
@samccone, I see what you might have been saying before with \n\n```js\nexpect(spy2).toHaveBeenCalledOn(sinon.match.instanceOf(Marionette.Behavior));\n```\n\nnot sure how you'd get a reference to dropdownBehavior...\n```js\nexpect(spy2.toHaveBeenCalledOn(dropdownBehavior)).toBe(true)\n```
ha - maybe add an initialize callback to a view and do some variable hoisting :)
the problem with this test is that its ambiguous
and i am ok with it being like this
i am too. just offering suggestions
ok 1.7.2 is out
going home
gonna do that wreqr update
@samccone,
are you fine with commands also accepting any object as a handler?
it doesn\u2019t make any sense, but because reqres and commands are powered by the same thing, i have a sense it would be a bit hacky to prevent commands from registering things other than functions
yes
doin that now
should be done soon!
wreqr 1.2.0 :)
Good morning/evening gents!!

lol - new is relative...
Behaviors are freakin great, here's `HotKeys` a behavior we wrote for handling shortcuts in our views https://gist.github.com/jasonLaster/9774053
oh @jasonLaster https://gist.github.com/jasonLaster/9774053#file-hotkeys-js-L48
there is a bettwe way to do this
ooh, how?
/textarea|select|input/i.test(document.activeElement.nodeName)
yeah but this is great
Very cool
@samccone, does this make sense? https://gist.github.com/jasonLaster/9774053#file-hotkeys-js-L84
i think...
trying to grok it
I think I had it in my head that a behavior would not access the view directly, but this made a lot of sense for the `keyPress` interface we wanted...
the behavior can touch the view
the view should not touch the behavior
Isn\u2019t hiding everything in private scope like that gonna make testing difficult?
yea, extremely difficult :)
well you are testing the interface
not the implementation details 
so\u2026 not really
the keypress library was actually supposed to be seperate from the behavior
by the way, everyone on my team is super psyched about Behaviors.
they keep finding more uses for it
1.7.2 is out
> not the implementation details\n\nI would want to test any function in there that has logic
fixed the event binding 
What do you guys think about API docs?
Beaviours docs have already made it into Dash, cool!
I like the API bit in there :)
in where?
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/47552986/Screenshots/n7.png
you mean this?
Yea
ahh - the british behaviours :)
But I was thinking a separate (maybe auto-generated) API docs
non-murican*
haha - we don't support that here.
Why doesn\u2019t CSS support colour!!!!!
Backbone-style docs might be a little too much to maintain, but I do like them :)
@samccone, what do you think of #1055?
here's a test that reproduces it - https://github.com/jasonLaster/backbone.marionette/commit/9d91d088ede359b1faf29ee967d3e069f708a32b
yeah i know UI elements do not work
never added it
UI interpolation 
for events
just did not add it in
I have no opposition to it
yea, that's what we're talking about here
the other thing I could see coming down the pike is view ui being interpolated into behavior events
sounds complicated, but I could see it being used a lot.
they both could i suppose 
cool - will take a stab at this. You've been having all the fun with `behaviorEvents`
gotta do one thing first, but should get around to it in 30 mins or so.
this is such a good example
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/47552986/Screenshots/na.png
of how simple complex shit it with marionette
What did you add?

about to turn it into a PR. Kinda a little scary because of the way normalizeUI mutates events, but I think it should be kosher.
Yea, looks ok though
Could do with a better commit message
I do like dogecoins in our tests

so doge. wow!
candid?
@jmeas STOP TALKING TO YOUR GF
@jmeas THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT
Yea @jmeas \u2026 what @samccone said!!
hmmm now the question is @jasonLaster can be put this is 1.8
yea, about that. now rebased off master
i think we are ok
normalizeUI was never something peopel would extend...
and even if they did
it will still work
we are fine
yeah, left that there for that reason. we should probably remove that in 2.0 just because.
@jasonLaster have etsy sponser a marionette meetup
i will come
my entire talk will be on
happy to provide the space and beer

This guy, he is really cool: https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/src/marionette.domRefresh.js#L32
i'm sure i knew that startWithParent worked bc of initializers when I was working on the module tests, but I forgot that immediately after.

if anyone wants to reply to this
I don't know if this is the right place but I need some advice on how to train a classifier using a data set with multiple feature types: text, integers, floats, dates
any idea?
My first approach was to convert each feature to binary, example: feature 1 -> \the word w_i is in column j?\ , feature 2 -> \the value in column j is greater than 10?\ feature 3 -> \the month in the date of column j was abril?\ etc.
Thanks for starting on the reviews :)
I want to do the `check_array` empty data first
I'm with family this week and so not super active, but I hope we can work towards the release next week :)
sure. There is another check_array pr that might be conflicting
and that I think is very important
the dtype=object one
yeah, I got side-tracked to work on clusterlib the past 2 weeks, I hope I will rebalance effort to sklearn next week as well
what is the issue number of dtype=object?
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4057
Most of the bug-fixes are isolated to one estimator. So I think they are important for the release, but shouldn't interact with other issues so much. The ones that are more API-ish are the dtype=object one (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4057), the clustering / pipeline one https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4064 and the input validation one https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4136
the last two interact somewhat. not sure how clear that is from the PR but the main thing in the input validation is that it extends common tests to estimators that don't inherit from clustering, classification, regression or transformation mixins
I'll try but I'm not sure I'll finish writing the pipeline integration tests today
oh and going toward the release, we need to fix the bugs and regressions in isotonic regression :-/ I don't think a fix exists yet
the slinear side effects?
I saw it broke the calibration PR
too many open tabs, my firefox is so slow at times...
it did? I didn't see that. haha I know the open tabs issue. Well the ``slinear`` broke some cases of ``fit`` and ``fit_transform`` not doing the same thing. Maybe it broke other things, too.
Bugs that are not regressions are that fit and fit_transform were not consistent before in the case of ties, and that having sample_weight=0 in multiple places can lead to infinite loops in the isotonic regression code
that's bad
I agree. I proposed a fix in one of the issues. Maybe just remove the implementation of ``fit_transform``, that is use the naive fit.transform, and mask out sample_weight=0. That should get rid of the worst bugs.
but doesn't solve all issues with tie-breaking, I think.
some discussion here: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/2507 and in the issues linked at the bottom
So that was a list of the \hard\ issues / PRs. If you want I can also give you a list of the simple bug fixes lol
what are you working on with clusterlib btw?
I want to implement the `concurrent.futures` API. That includes porting cloudpickle.py to Python 3 or implemeting something similar with dill.
The goal is to be able to use SGE / SLURM clusters easily, without having to write bash or boilerplate python scripts.
There is also cloudpi.pe to watch in the same space.
going grab some lunch, see you later
Args. I am slightly confused by the current API requirements in pipeline. If ``fit_transform`` accepts ``y=None`` we don't require ``transform`` to accept a ``y=None``. That is somewhat inconsistent and weird, I think...
Huh ok transform is never passed ``y`` at all... never mind...
@amueller I am reviewing #4057
In another PR I suggested in a comment to add support for the `dtype=[np.float64, np.float32]` idiom.
but I don't remember which PR ;)
I think the dtype='numeric' is a fine, loose default but I would like to check with the other PR if we also need the `dtype=<list of accepted dtypes idiom>` for specific cases as well.
do you remember which PR it was?
Ok found it: it was collapsed in: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4136#discussion_r24176562
yeah so a dtype list for check_array would be nice, and then we could get rid of ``as_float_array``
I agree
\unfriend all multi-output estimators on facebook.\
There was only slight frustration on my part. I'm not sure if the ``y_numeric`` is a good workaround, because it somehow stipulates that by default \y\ are arbitrary objects aka classification labels
btw, there are not really that many tests on ``y``.  Many estimators just used ``np.asarray(y)``...
we should probably test for finite targets for regression
I don't understand what you mean by finite targets
integers & categorical labels?
I meant for regression, where the target is a float
Hey all! :)\n@ogrisel You might want to set up gitter to get live activity feeds on the right! Choose github and travis under integrations ( under settings )
@ragv done! thanks for the tip
It seems that I broke travis but I cannot reach the report page. Running the tests locally.
Ok fixing the broken tests ATM
Scikit learn has crossed 5000 stars on github :beer:
ogrisel, are you around?
Hi @amueller sorry I was offline for the past couple of days as I had to attend local events. Today I will be working on clusterlib with a colleague. tomorrow I will be available to review PRs on sklearn
Alright. Next week I'll be at strata, though, and won't have much time. We should settle on a timeline for release.
What about setting the objective of cutting the first beta on Friday Feb 27.
Then one beta every two weeks.
And release end of March?
Sounds good :)
@ogrisel Would you be interested in setting up http://landscape.io and landscape bot? #3888 
Refer [this](https://landscape.io/github/ragv/scikit-learn) for live preview of our repo and [this](https://github.com/hugovk/word-tools/pull/7#issuecomment-67533284) for an example comment by the bot.
A general suggestion... I feel it would be more helpful to debug test results if we replaced docstrings for tests by comment... \nOutput when a docstring is present for a test\n```\nTests all estimators which support partial_fit ... ok\nTests all estimators which support partial_fit ... ok\nTests all estimators which support partial_fit ... ok\n```\nOutput when no docstring is present for a test\n```\ntest_common.test_partial_fit('Perceptron', <class 'sklearn.linear_model.perceptron.Perceptron'>) ... ok\ntest_common.test_partial_fit('Perceptron', <class 'sklearn.linear_model.perceptron.Perceptron'>) ... ok\ntest_common.test_partial_fit('Perceptron', <class 'sklearn.linear_model.perceptron.Perceptron'>) ... ok\ntest_common.test_partial_fit('SGDClassifier', <class 'sklearn.linear_model.stochastic_gradient.SGDClassifier'>) ... ok\n```
Trying out gitter from irc
@ragv thanks for the invite
I agree about the test docstring issue.
@ogrisel would it be worth to have a pr for that? Or should I just create an issue and refer that when any related code is changed?
Explaining the pbm in an issue is a good idea. Then a bunch of small PRs related to that issue if people have no objection.
Alternatively we could use this on travis: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose-ignore-docstring
Ah! thanks ;) that was helpful! Sorry should have googled a bit before asking...
and in the makefile, I'd say
don't we even have a nose config file in the repo?
Im about to send a PR for that ;)
and yea `setup.cfg`
:) oh we do need to install a package, I thought it was a build-in option
yea It will go in `continuous-integration/install.sh` after `pip install nose`
@amueller How do you feel about https://github.com/finnp/gitter-irc-bot ?
It look really very simple and could cleanly sync irc and gitter...
I'll take care of the setup...
sounds ok but I don't have too many cycles to look into it. you can do it and see if anyone complains about noise (which is unlikely)
hey hey. I'm kinda back, though somehow in Dallas.
And I only have ~400 unread github notifications
@amueller how did you enjoy strata?
It was pretty awesome :) met a lot of interesting people. Are you bug-crunching this week? I have to do some organisational stuff for GSOC but the rest of the week should be free for release things.
I was having a look at the FDR PR and trying to understand why the actual FDR is always lower than alpha. I am working on something else tonight. Will resume tomorrow. I think I have an idea.
> And I only have ~400 unread github notifications\n\nhaha :p  
How do I make sure the cython sources are compiled when I rebuild for testing? ( related to #4288 ) ?
cython path/to/file.pyx
@amueller here I mean
so much sense
sorry about that
btw what time is it in Paris? Are you in Paris?
yes I am in paris
it's almost midnight
I am rebasing #3945 then going to bed
sweet, thanks. tomorrow I will be in the office earlier. Thanks for working late :)
For some reason I tagged the old SVC.sparse_decision_function PR with 0.16, but not my new one. That doesn't make sense. Do you think I should tag my PR or untag the old?
Actually I was primarily working on dl-machine this evening :)
> For some reason I tagged the old SVC.sparse_decision_function PR with 0.16, but not my new one. That doesn't make sense. Do you think I should tag my PR or untag the old?\n\nI am not sure which is which
dl-machine?
rephrasing my question: should the sparse decision function be tagged for 0.16 or not (i.e. is it a priority to go into the release)
ah, I see. Are you working with torch or theano primarily?
https://github.com/deeplearningparis/dl-machine
setting up tutorial material for a workshop on theano, but adding support for torch was easy so I added it.
+1 for including the sparse decision function fix
that means 23 PRs left for the release lol
have a good night. Hope we make some more progress on the PRs this week
Even if we don't fix them all prior to friday (the first beta) it's fine. As long as we only include fixes in the 0.16.X branch once the beta is cut.
anything in particular that you would like me to review?
Did you have a look at this one yet: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4192 I haven't really followed what is happening with the pos_label etc in the metrics
Hey :) sorry to interrupt you... do you feel we could do the data indep. cv part first and later do the renaming?
There are two roads we could go down: either doing both together, but using the fact to have a deprecation path for it. That would mean copying a lot of code for a while. OR doing them separately. If we do them separately, I would do the CV objects first. Also, I wouldn't do either for the 0.16 release, I think.
Actually, I think the code duplication thing is not necessary, so we should just focus on the cv objects
@ogrisel green button on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4249 (sign flip) ?
Okay! so I'll salvage #4294 to do the CV related fixes alone?
yeah that sounds like a good idea
Just one more minor thing... what is the expected range of scores ( w.r.t #4295 ) ( could it by any chance be >= 40? )
the sigmoid should be between 0 and 1 as you plotted, and the votes shouldn't be larger than the number of classes, right?
if the values for `sum_of_confidences` ( previously `scores` ) exceed 34 we get 1 which is not desirable... i.e `expit(34)` is 1... with 0.5 it extends upto 73...
or am I too paranoid? perhaps `scores` do not extend  upto 34?
sorry, I don't follow. scores can be arbitrary high. You say that it actually reaches 1? that seems a bit odd
I see... maybe then we need to do 0.9 * expit(scores) ? which would be just another magic value....
sorry its at 37.... and yea in my system `expit(37) == 0`... would you mind confirming the same pl?
you mean == 1
In [9]: expit(37)\nOut[9]: array(0.9999999999999999)\n\nIn [10]: expit(38)\nOut[10]: array(1.0)\n
I commented on the issue and pinged @mblondel 
yes :P sorry again...
np. you are right, that is an issue
Perhaps we could scale to `[0, 1]` before mapping it using sigmoid? ( it would be a tad slower )
that is also weird ;)
took me only 3 days to catch up with 7 days of sklearn notifications....
now for some actual work
That was fast ;)  What issue are you currently working on? :)
I have to do some pystruct stuff now because I commited to some research projects. Other than that, I'm working on getting as many PRs as possible that are tagged with 0.16 in, and writing as many bug-fixes for 0.16 tagged issues as possible
mostly reviewing currently
@ogrisel this one should also be simple: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4082
are you working on the isotonic stuff right now? Anything I should review?
ah, you are doing https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4082, cool :)
yes #4082, I am resolving conflicts (both syntactic and logic), almost done. running the full test suite
previously I was trying to understand what's wrong with the isotonic transform (interp1d with kind='slinear')
the bug you found (the infinite loop with zero sample weight) is something entirely different
yeah maybe that was a bad idea. but it was already broken before
both are important bugs we should make a priority to fix IMHO.
I know the bugs are unrelated, but I thought the fix might be. I was thinking about removing the implementation of partial fit, which would make it easier to fix both bugs, I think
I don't understand the details of any of the 2 bugs at the moment, feel free to investigate on your side
Are you sure this is related to partial_fit?
args I meant fit_transform
err fit_predict?
I kind of understand the infinite loop. there is a while x != y and if both are NAN then it never finishes. The easiest way to solve the problem is to remove data points with zero sample weight. But if you do that, you can not implement fit_predict the way it currently is.
The other way would be to take care of zero sample weight in the Cython code, but I don't understand that part 100%
fixed https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4189
ok, but this seem completely independent from the bug found in transform by mjbommard in #4185
when I last checked, I had the impression that some of the inconsistencies come from the way that fit_transform is implemented. If it is indeed only an error in transform, then they are unrelated.
I'll double check.
it does look like fit_transform works correctly, never mind then
it seems different versions of scipy give different results
which version of scipy are you running and how the test fail in your case ?
I need to run catch my shuttle. not sure I will be able to work on that further today but will catch up tomorrow
ok. I'll try to look into it more today. Now my tests are failing the same way yours are doing. But I had different results on my different laptop
this one is on 0.13.3
what is the difference between \predict\ and \transform\ in isotonic regression?
ah, there is none. Isn't that slightly confusing?
It is, mayve we could deprecate transform in favor of predict.
fyi https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4285 should be good
I had some weird behavior with the interp1d but I need to do some NYU stuff before I can investigate further
@amueller can I take up the newly tagged easy issues, assuming this will help u release the 0.16 beta cut or should I leave those for a new contributor instead?\n
which ones in particular? For the release only the tagged issues are important imho
I had meant #4298, #4296, #4292... but I just realized I had one unfinished 0.16 tagged PR - #4225... I'll work on it instead :)
you can leave the three issues for new people, or you can go for them. But they are really low priority. Finishing up the other PRs you already have open might be better for us at the moment.
yea :) thanks!
@ogrisel how are things?
hi @amueller , I got side tracked on other stuff. I merged the BernoulliNB fix though. Still need to understand the isotonic transform stuff
and you ?
I looked into it. I can work on it the rest of the day. It seems we need to do it ourselves. I can't make sense of the scipy results. I posted a notebook in the issue.
I'll upgrade scipy to see if the results look the same, but I think we need to implement our own way to deal with duplicates
anything else you'd consider blocking?
ok
let me scan throught the remaining issues
I am not happy about this: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/4262
I think this would be good to get in: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4121
This is an easy fix for pretty bad bug: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4182 (DPGMM.sample() giving attribute error)
Would be good to get your sparse decision function as well as it seems ready to me.
Will do #4274 now.
There is also the setup.py fix to leverage wheelhouse uploader to automate wheel upload
Yeah I think I +1'd that one
I think the decision function is ready, too, but it needs another review.
I will have a look at #4121 now
argl #4121 highlight an API bug that went trough the initia LSHForest reviews: the shape of the values returned by radius_neighbors is not consistent with the exact methods
I will open a new issue for this specific point
I have a naive fix for https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4302 but there are backward compatibility issues.
argl there is also the dtype=object compat issue
in brute force
this is annoying as well.
I am hungry and tired. I think I will stop here for tonight and resume work on neighbors stuff tomorrow. I would like to fix all the neighbors API issue and isotonic stuff (I need to read the paper on the tie breaking stuff) before cutting the beta. That make me thing that we can move the target to Monday for the beta.
@amueller WDYT?
Sounds good. I have time on the weekend. The tie-breaking stuff is not hard, but we have to make a choice (See my PR). If we agree that that PR is the way to go, it needs cython code, I think.
dtype=object in the output or the input?
For the inputs is should be fine everywhere now, methinks
output of radius_neighbors
which is fine
but brute does not follow the behavior of  balltree and kdtree
I thought that was fixed. all should output dtype=object now
should have been fixed here: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4046/files
or are you talking about this: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1400
ok maybe it's missing a rebase
I will have look tomorrow
ok, have a good night :)
thanks good night as well ;)
I fixed the isotonic part and wrote the necessary cython
@ogrisel what is your plan for the day? I didn't have much time on the weekend unfortunately :-/
no pbm. I just pushed #4317 to tackle the remaining docstring and test issues w.r.t. radius_neighbors. Please feel free to have a look.
I will now catch up on your work on isotonic regression. I think it looks good from a first look at it. Will test it a bit more. That might make it possible to remove the random tie breaking in the calibration code.
The behavior is different from what it was before, but I think this is the only way to make fit().transform() and fit_transform() be the same.
I'll head t othe office now and look at #4317 once I'm ther
Alright. I will be offline for 1h (commute back home from saclay) but should get back online afterwards.
damn time difference ;)
It's also because I have to commute early in the morning and in the afternoon to take a shuttle bus that avoids most of the Paris rush hour traffic :) I would not wake up at 6:30am naturally otherwise...
I a good paper to read on hyperparam search on the way back home :)
the one kyle sent around? Jasper Snoek will give a talk at NYU on Friday :)
yes
it seems only useful when you can use a big compute cluster for a week though. Still it looks interesting.
It means that we might be able to use the future MLP model for hyperparam search instead of trying to fix the GP to make them efficient ;)
well spearmint uses the sklearn random forests for hyperparameter search l)
so we could also use that ;)
yes but apparently it does not reach the quality of the solution of bayes optimization with GPs or NNs.
Nor does TPEs, at least in the benchmarks run in this paper.
anyway let's focus back on the release :)
btw, for https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/2274 currently the random projections are pretty loud
#4318
wait, which is the paper you read on the train? not this one, right? http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03492v2.pdf
I guess this one: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05700.pdf
do we have a link to the pdf docs on the website? I think we don't :-/ where should it go?
I read the one by Snoek, but also read the other 2 weeks ago I think.
> do we have a link to the pdf docs on the website? I think we don't :pensive: where should it go?\nno we don't, we don't build it on a regular basis but we could. It should be possible to upload it as part of the build process.
after this the latex build should be relatively clean: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4320
anything you want me to review / work on?
Is there a way to make `GridSearchCV` act without the CV part ( do parameters `cv=None` or `refit` help in this context )?
You can precompute a single test train split:\ntrain_idx, validation_idx = train_test_split(n_samples, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\ncv = [(train_idx, validation_idx)]\nGridSearchCV(model, cv=cv).fit(X, y)
I am using your code in a comment at #4301...
I made a mistake:
train_idx, validation_idx = train_test_split(np.arange(n_samples), test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
missing the np.arange
it might be interesting to have the ability to not split into training and test data for unsupervised algorithms.
what does setting cv to None do currently?
Perhaps we could set cv to -1 for that behaviour?
@amueller unsupervised scores can still overfit
it depends on the context. For clustering, where you can not even evaluate on non-training data, it totally makes sense.
I'm looking into the sphinx thing but I'm not entirely clear on how to achieve this. I don't know where to hook it in. Did you have time to look at the isotonic stuff?
indeed
I thought about k-means where predict is possible but this is not always the case, for instance when clustering is done on a precompute distance or similarity matrix
I am testing it now
the isotonic
@amueller for #4301, do you think the metrics might be useful?
possibly. I didn't have much time to look at them yet
this is not really a priority as I want to get stuff clean and fixed for the release first
Okay... I'll just leave a comment there... take a look if you happen to find time after the release related work :)
+1 for not working on not introducing any new feature that has not already received a significant amount of reviews.
Rephrasing: I meant not working on PR introducing new features unless it has already been reviewed extensively.
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4313
is part of the kneighbors_graph fix where you can press the green button. I agree that this should be in the beta
haha I merged it before reading your message here ;)
haha I just saw it and thought you read my message ;)
anything I should look at now? btw, does beta mean uploading docs?
probably not I guess?
no, no site change for the beta. But it's good to fix it anyway :)
so the plan is uploading a non-default pipy package and writing a mail? and wheels?
Maybe then I should focus on the very verbose tests ^^
As I said above, if you have anything on your wishlist, let me know
yes
verbose tests and maybe decide on #4309 because it has a slight API impact.
and off-course the isotonic  and radius PRs that should be ready to merge very soon now.
it's midnight here, I think I will call it a day on my side
see you tomorrow. Tomorrow morning I will work to prepare a team meeting on probability calibration and meeting in the afternoon. Should be online after that.
well but for those we need another reviewer, right?
have a good night and see you tomorrow
yes we need other reviewers for those.
looks like you got a lot of reviewing done already, sweet :)
care to weight in on the class_weight discussion?
we really need someone else for reviews :-/
@agramfort are you around?
there is another bugfix here @ogrisel  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4326
I merged the RBM fix and docs after Kyle +1'ed
15 left.
15 PRs left.
woah getting late again on your side ;)
10PRs left I think
oh, wrong filter. 14PRs
the agglomerative clustering one I am not sure about. I don't know what the canonical meaning of alpha is. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/3758
@amueller for the partial_fit tests PR do you think there is still a lot of testing code that could be reduced/removed?
I'm not really sure
@ogrisel are you there and do you have time to talk about an outline for the webcast?
@amueller  Sorry I was feeling sick yesterday night and I did not go online.
I started thinking about it, we can do:\n- general intro to ML in Python with scikit-learn\n- couple of words on the project organization and the team of contributors\n- highlight of some new stuff in 0.16: improvement on speed or scalability of some methods such as:\n   - IncrementalPCA\n   - clustering (I am preparing a notebook comparing DBSCAN, MiniBatchKMeans, KMeans and Birch on 100k blobish 2D points to simulate someone working to extract Point of Interests from raw geo location data (e.g. GSM phone records)\n- new Approximate Nearest Neighbors search with LSHForest\nThen for the future we could talk about TSNE and algorithmic improvements under review in the pipeline
I forgot, I also wanted to say a couple of words about probability calibration
Right, calibration is not on my list.  Is it in whatsnew?
Oh, and a title
Hope you are feeling better today
News from scikit-learn 0.16 and soon-to-be gems for the next release. ??
sounds good to me
I am half feeling better, really weird
some hours I feel sick and then completely fine for a while
that's weird
I played a bit with clustering on 1e5 points in 2D
http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ogrisel/notebooks/blob/master/sklearn_demos/Large%20Scale%202D%20Clustering.ipynb
DBSCAN is 3x faster than 0.15.2
MB KMeans is still the fastest although it does not deal with outliers as DBSCAN does
cool :) and there are still faster DBSCAN variants in the PRs
there is a pretty new PR on that I think
Birch core set extraction seems to works great but the final affinity clustering pass is not as scalable as the core set extraction
what's on todays agenda for the release?
or what was for you ;)
no progress on isotonic I see
would you mind having a look at https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/4324
I guess I start reviewing the non-release PRs now. Or is there anything to review left?
Delaying the beta even more seems a bit silly to me, but the only other option is to merge the remaining urgent fixes with fewer reviews
I am having a look at the DBSCAN. Let's release the beta tomorrow. Whatever the review state of the remaining PRs. we will do backports for the fixes afterwards for the second beta.
you want a second beta? Alright....
maybe not
it depends how stable we find the beta
I would like to merge this https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4028 before cutting the beta branch
go for it. It shouldn't interfere with anything.
ok
Do you think we should get this one in soon: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4228
If it's ready soon, +1 for a backport to the 0.16.X branch.
ok
maybe we can do: beta tomorrow, continue backports of fixes and target 0.16 in 2 or 3 weeks. And if we fix additional important bugs, 0.16.1 in a month and half
yeah, sounds good.
 we should really release more regularly.
I will be in PyCon at that point but you can do the 0.16.1 with the help of others if I am not responsive enough at that point.
Alright. I don't think I'll make it this year.
you are not coming to scipy are you?
nope
I was planning to attend ICML as a free-styler because is just 1h by train
Hey :) could you help me with #4228 ? I don't understand a few things... When testing you said I could use multilabel data right? but which classifier do I test against? (or if you might have time could you take over?)
Try a tree? Or use OneVsRestClassifer(LogisticRegression).
I'll have a look soon.
will grid search propagate the parameters from `OneVsRestClassifier` to `LogisticRegression`?
and thanks :)
probably with ``estimator__``. But I'd rather go with a tree, which should work
okay I'll push in sometime... pl see if I am in the right direction or kindly take over... sorry for having kept you waiting over that :)
A small doubt do you use multiple monitors? ;)
no why?
Just curious how @amueller could be online and commenting at the same time :O\nI am online sometimes while I work since I use vim in a transparent guake terminal over the gitter chat window... :)
no transparency here. I technically have a laptop monitor and a large one, but in the office I currently only use the large one. Still context-switching too much.
I have the gitter tab just always open
Ah :D :)
are you working on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4228 now or should I go for it? I only have like 2 hours of work left today, though ;)
Please go for it :) :P Most ests don't seem to support sparse y... :)
```\n======================================================================\nERROR: sklearn.tree.tests.test_tree.test_sparse_input('DecisionTreeClassifier', 'sparse-mix', None)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nose/case.py\ line 197, in runTest\n    self.test(*self.arg)\n  File \.../scikit-learn/sklearn/tree/tests/test_tree.py\ line 1051, in check_sparse_input\n    y_sparse)\n  File \.../scikit-learn/sklearn/tree/tree.py\ line 221, in fit\n    \number of samples=%d\ % (len(y), n_samples))\nValueError: Number of labels=1 does not match number of samples=20\n-------------------- >> begin captured stdout << ---------------------\n```\nPerhaps the `len(y)` needs to be changed to `_num_samples(y)` here...
maybe... but with dense y it works?
Even after changing to `_num_samples(y)` the error seems to persist :|
ok let me look at it tomorrow
I am working on the polishing of the no-shuffle DBSCAN
running the tests and should merge soon.
I'm thinking about the class_weight heuristic
I have not read the reference. Do you?
I meant \have you?\ not \do you?\
skimmed. But it makes more sense. I'll post a regression test in a second.
Alright, I will call it a day. See you tomorrow!
alright. you work soo much later than I do.... Have a good night and see you tomorrow
@amueller , just so you're aware, when I was messing with how to structure the forests' class_weight implementations, I noticed float-point numerical differences in some little toy test datasets between a couple of different implementations that differed only in where or how i was multiplying, say sample weight and bootstrap weights. 
I'd expect that the change in #4347 will definitely change the way small floating point differences are evaluated. This obviously has a big effect in trees as magnitude doesn't matter, just gini improvement... So the outputs using class_weight between implementations will likely be different for forests, probably trees. Not that this really matters as they are both entering @ 0.16
Long story short, I think SVMs and Linear Models could potentially change a little bit with #4347, though not as bad as trees I'm guessing. I'm not sure what \promise\ is made to users about reproducibility between scikit-learn versions... 
Unfortunately we cannot promise much for those cases. It would be interesting to check the actual impact of the correct heuristic on some datasets though. 
@amueller @ogrisel could we use `0.5 - np.finfo(float).resolution` for #4295 (With the assumption that, it wouldn't be considered a magic no. since 0.5 is a standard symmetric scaling factor?) to scale it to `(-0.5, 0.5)`?
@ogrisel fair enough. I'll try to find some time this weekend to run some experiments. I agree that the new implementation is more intuitive, just throwing it out there.
@amueller shall we try to cut the 0.16.X branch?
@ogrisel feel free. do we want to backport the isotonic stuff then? Or take @mjbommar's +1?
Let's do the isotonic merge now
I think it's tested enought both by the isotonic tests and the probability calibration tests to be correct.
I feel the same way
do you want to press the green button or should I do the rebase dance?
@mjbommar's fix is not in a PR...
I pressed the green button.
ok. and merge the other fix on top? It has my +1 and yours
Let's create the PR ourselves from his branch :)
Should I create PR or just merge?
I guess we want to run travis once
Yes better create the PR from his branch to get travis to run it.
I'm on it
actually it's not possible to create the PR directly from his branch as we need to get rid of the past commits:
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/compare/master...mjbommar:issue-4297-infinite-isotonic
that are redundant with your own PR
I let you do the cherry-pick
I did a rebase thing
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4352
should we wait for feedback on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4322 and then backport it?
warnings in the beta seem not that bad
yes +1 for waiting for this one
@amueller unfortunately I won't have time to cut the branch tonight. I have to go now. Feel free to do it, push a commit with the 0.16b1 version number (that follows PEP-440) and push a tag with pointing to it. That should get the CI workers to build the wheels. If everything goes well we should be able to push the release to PyPI (after testing on https://testpypi.python.org/pypi first) using wheelhouse-uploader.
I will be busy tomorrow (we organize a deep learning workshop in Paris) and on sunday I should be mostly offline.
I can push the release on PyPI on Monday if appveyor works well.
Ok, then I'll do it this afternoon. Mail to mailing list after pypi push? Or wait for appveyor?
travis is slow today...
Are there instructions on the wheel builts in the docs?
I would like to wait for appveyor and MacPython : https://github.com/MacPython/wiki/wiki/Spinning-wheels
wrong copy and paste
I meant: https://github.com/MacPython/scikit-learn-wheels
what version number do you leave on master after doing the beta? Still 0.16-dev?
I changed the master to follow PEP-440, so it's 0.16.dev0 at the moment
It should move to 0.17.dev0 once the 0.16.X branch has been cut.
I granted you push rights to https://github.com/MacPython/scikit-learn-wheels
Ok, wasn't sure if we do that after the beta or the release, but makes sense if we branch.
once the scikit-learn 0.16b1 tag has been pushed to our github repo, we have to update the git submodules of https://github.com/MacPython/scikit-learn-wheels to point to it to get the travis bots of that repo to build all the Mac OSX wheels for that release.
merge this on green then branching? https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4352
yes
I have to go now, sorry for leaving you alone.
Andy could you quickly take a look at #4228 to see if the test to be satisfied is correct. I'm using that as an objective for that PR! (I'll iterate different fixes till that test is satisfied...)
I've reopened #4228 as #4354 since #4228 won't reopen (more precisely, github won't track branches against which closed PRs were raised... So #4228 remains at 0+0- even after pushing the new commit to that branch and hence won't reopen as it brings about no change) Sorry for wasting an issue no.! :/
Sorry, as I'll have to take care of the beta now, so I won't have time to look into the issue
@ogrisel so if we don't build /upload the docs on beta, what should the links in the navigation of the \documentation\ page be? I guess we have to fix them later....
because now there will not be any 0.16 documentation online
pushed the tag, updated the MacPython wheels.
No there won't be any 0.16 website, before the 0.16 final release but I think this is fine. dev points to 0.17.dev0 and stable points to 0.15.2
next time we upload the website we should remove the version for the link to the development documentation number from the documentation menu.
Is there a nice cython guide that I could use? (Related to #4354 for `_tree.pyx` to make it support sparse y)
@amueller I tried to install the macwheels in a new venv and it works:

However the version number is not good
Actually it's my bad, it picked up the wrong wheel (because of the old version  number 0.16-git that is considered more recent than 0.16.b1)
We won't have the problem when we upload on pypi as we won't upload that 0.16-git wheel

I am launching the tests now
All tests pass with the 0.16b1 wheel on my OSX laptop
On windows on the other hand, the wheels were not uploaded because the tests are broken: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sklearn-ci/scikit-learn/history
They have been broken for a while and I had not noticed
Here is the error message:\n```\n[00:15:09] ======================================================================\n[00:15:09] FAIL: Test that scorers support sample_weight or raise sensible errors\n[00:15:09] ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n[00:15:09] Traceback (most recent call last):\n[00:15:09]   File \C:\\Python34-x64\\lib\\site-packages\\nose\\case.py\ line 198, in runTest\n[00:15:09]     self.test(*self.arg)\n[00:15:09]   File \C:\\Python34-x64\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\utils\\testing.py\ line 300, in wrapper\n[00:15:09]     return fn(*args, **kwargs)\n[00:15:09]   File \C:\\Python34-x64\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\metrics\\tests\\test_score_objects.py\ line 343, in test_scorer_sample_weight\n[00:15:09]     \{2}\.format(name, weighted, unweighted))\n[00:15:09] AssertionError: 0.29999999999999999 == 0.29999999999999999 : scorer recall_samples behaves identically when called with sample weights: 0.3 vs 0.3\n[00:15:09] \n[00:15:09] ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n```
I created this to track it: #4358
I pushed a fix for master (hopefully)
Apparently you did not push the 0.16.X branch to the repo. I cannot cherry-pick the fix (c23d4f31a3fcd7b24e46d46df6f2d274a839b201) to get it into the 0.16.X branch.
huh, pretty sure I pushed the 0.16.X branch. 
the tag is in the branch
hum ok guess I didn't push it. I pushed with --tags, apparently that only pushes the taggs
so which branch is this commit in? 09dc09a1e9d9088c2cb783c818980f5509d77a11
fixed it, I think
@amueller I fixed #4358
it was a missing `random_state`, do you want me to do the backport?
yeah, go ahead. the branch should be there now.
pushed
let's wait for appveyor to build the wheels
btw, where is the continuous integration on appveyor? I'm sure there is a badge for that so we can see when it breaks
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sklearn-ci/scikit-learn/
I have to go offline now. I might get back online tomorrow evening Paris time. If we are both online at that point we can push the release to PyPI together. Otherwise on monday. If the windows wheels are all generated correctly and you feel confident to use the upload-all command of the wheelhouse-uploader tool, feel free to do it before that.
Ok, I'll check back tomorrow, not gonna do anything today I think
ok have a nice WE then :)
you too!
I think I would need to login to get the badge url
well we can use shields: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/sklearn-ci/scikit-learn/master.svg
spectral embedding doesn't accept lists... Should that be considered an issue?
the function or the class?
the `fit` method I had meant
are you sure? That should be a common test. It might be that the common test doesn't cover clustering yet. Then this should be fixed.
Yes `SpectralEmbedding().fit([[1, 2]])` doesn't work... Ok I'll fix it and add tests for that...
SpectralEmbedding is neither a clustering nor or a classifier nor a transformer, just and estimator. This is probably the reason it's not caught by any of the common tests.
Ok all 0.16b1 wheels have been properly generated by the CI workers. To fetch them all:\n```\npip install wheelhouse-uploader\ncd scikit-learn\ngit checkout 0.16.X\npython setup.py fetch_artifacts\n```
I am now launching a windows VM to test the windows wheels manually with the latest versions of numpy and scipy
But the the test for lists should be in ``test_non_meta_estimators`` which tests everything
But the checks that check for list data are:\n    check_clustering,\n    check_regressors_train,\n    check_transformer, ...
yeah that is bad
pretty sure it can be done in a general way
the problem is that to call fit on a list we need to know the structure of y and values that yield fast yet non-crashing fit calls.
but it's probably doable as you said
what are the VMs doing? Btw, is appveyor only building for tags? or is it also doing continuous integration?
appveyor builds everything pushed to the main repo (master, branches and tags)
I have updated the wiki to add the commands to fetch and upload the wheels.
I still need to run the tests manually on windows, both with manually installed numpy and scipy and once with christoph gohlke's packages for numpy and scipy.
once this is done we should be able to push 0.16b1 to PyPI
we should also add the appveyor shields to the readme, then. Or is there any notification if it breaks?
I don't really understand the notification configuration but I do receive emails. I don't know who else receive them when it breaks.
you did not receive any appveyor notification in the past?
no
maybe we could create a new SF mailing list and find a way to authorize the appveyor bot to send email to it.
but let me finish the windows testing first.
@amueller can you please try to fetch the artifacts on your workstation with the previous commands I posted to check that it works?
the wheels shure
running fetch_artifacts\nValueError: unknown url type: \n
I gotta run to the office now, I'll be there in 30 minutes
alright, can you try again and paste the full traceback you get?
FYI, I run the tests on windows + Python 3.4 64bit + cgohlke's numpy and scipy and all tests pass
Now trying with windows + Python 2.7.9 32 bit + official numpy and scipy from sourceforge
looks good so far
http://pastebin.com/uX1Ccr39
have you the latest version of wheelhouse-uploader ?
just pip-installed
all tests pass for windows + Python 2.7.9 32 bit + official numpy and scipy from sourceforge
let me try with Python 2.7
looks like there is a non-deterministic failure in lle on windows: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sklearn-ci/scikit-learn/build/1.0.547/job/r4p8ftc1v8f4x7kk
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sklearn-ci/scikit-learn/history
so somewhere in the wheelhouse-uploader there is a url \#\
http://pastebin.com/SY0L6hQE
I can reproduce the wheelhouse-uploader crash on Python 2.7
will have a look
MacPython is for releases only, no CI, right?
yes
we could setup a full OSX CI bot but that's more work to do.
I think it's possible to configure travis to have both linux and OSX in the same .travis.yml configuration.
We would probably need to change the adapt the scripts though. and honestly when all the tests pass on various python / numpy / scipy versions, they almost always pass under OSX as well
this is not the case for windows ;)
the remaining windows heisenfailures will be tedious to hunt down
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4364
are you uploading to pipy? Or are you debugging the wheels? I don't really have much experience with that
sorry I was discussing a fix for a joblib with a colleague
joblib bug, the one with read_zfile / write_zfile that is broken when switching from py2 to py3
we now understand the pbm :)
ok so back to the release
I can upload the wheels and fix wheelhouse uploader for python 2.7 afterwards if you want
Let me generate and test the .tar.gz first 
I don't think the wheelhouse uploader is really important. I think we should go ahead and upload to pipy
I am running the tests on a freshly installed .tar.gz generated with sdist (after a make clean in the doc folder) on linux
if everything is well I will launch the upload
```\nRan 4045 tests in 126.704s\n\nOK (SKIP=20)\n```
cool. just doing the same on my box ;)
(running the clean sdist, not uploading, that is)
upload under progress...
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-learn/0.16b1
sending an announcement email on the mailing list
I should have added a new 0.17 section in the whatsnew on master... well..
should we remove the 0.17 deprecated things (like the HMM) now or wait until the release?
As you wish for hmm.
+1 to add the 0.17 section on master.
I am in the shuttle now. Will go offline otherwise I get sick.
Do want to tweet?
I tweeted :)
Cheers for the 0.16b :beers:  
In [this cython code](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/neighbors/binary_tree.pxi#L1054) the `BinaryTree` seems to expose the metric as an attribute `dist_metric`.\nBut `dist_metric` attribute seems to be absent from the `BallTree` instance...\n```\nIn [7]: b.\nb.data                   b.get_tree_stats         b.node_bounds            b.query_radius           b.valid_metrics          \nb.get_arrays             b.idx_array              b.node_data              b.reset_n_calls          \nb.get_n_calls            b.kernel_density         b.query                  b.two_point_correlation  \n```\nNot sure where exactly I misunderstood :/
sorry, I'm not so familiar with that module, and I know Jake did some weird inheritance tricks there
Okay! thanks.. I think its got something to do with cdef classes ... will look into it! :)
Hmm... That requires a `public` keyword to make those attributes accessible to the python namespace!
Now that we have appveyor tests, there is an appveyor integration for gitter that we could configure!
we've had appveyor tests for a long time ;)
we just didn't look at them
Oh! I didn't know that :)
what needs to be done for integration?
Try Settings --> Integrations --> appveyor. Use this webhook https://webhooks.gitter.im/e/0dc8e57cd38105aeb1b4 :)
@ragv wonders who added the webhook :O
`/me` messages look too large in gitter :/
@ogrisel Seems to have added that from the git blame... I think he would have integrated it already (why aren't we getting notifications then?) Hmm... 
BTW there seems to be a chrome app for gitter for linux users - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitter/ldhcdmnhbafhckhidlhdbeekpifobpdc
landscape.io does not seem to be very mature yet. but could be cool and carl is pretty responsive
hello! yes, seems there are still several kinks to work out in the PR comparison logic
working on it!
haha didn't know you were here. Well your help is much appreciated!
@ragv just sent me an invite to the chatroom, probably to stop me cluttering up PR comments :)
:) comment whereever you like
@carlio Not at all :) I added you so we could ping and trouble you whenever we hit a snag with landscape :p :P Thanks for the nice work!
@carlio so does a push to a PR trigger a restart? I realize there would be some delay, though on the master branch landscape.io was pretty fast. Coveralls takes like a day to visit a PR if ever
@amueller Yes, Landscape gets a GitHub push hook to trigger the check, so it should start within a few seconds. It's a bit wobbly right now. It also polls every 5 minutes or so (legacy behaviour for before I set up the push hooks to trigger on PRs)
Does this (push to trigger) work for the old PRs too?
kinda, if they get a new pull request than yes
if they get a new commit
Thats awesome! I'll try out ;)
This one didn't get a report for half an hour: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4381 still pending or something up there?
slow travis today :-/
maybe we should ask around if someone wants to pay 250 USD / month for more travis power ^^
I sort of broke it a bit but it's running now
@amueller I think you can manually restart it...\nIn the travis build page there is an option to log in, once logged in you should get the option for restarting it...\n\n
incase you didn't know that already...
@ragv I know I can restart travis. The problem with travis is not that it is not restarting, the problem is that is is queueing.
Ah... okay! Sorry for the noise!
closing issues as non-issues is fun. anyhow, I gotta run. ttyl
btw, which time zone are you on @ragv?
See ya! I am in India GMT+05:30 :D
Just throwing in a minor suggestion! We could perhaps have another CI build and test in parallel... like codeship / wercker... Let me know your opinion about that when you get online again!! both seem to be very easy to setup!
(I have nothing to do with this repository but I'm a big fan of circle-ci)
Thanks for the suggestion! :)
@ogrisel why b2?
any major issues?
no, it's just that if we keep on backporting stuff to the 0.16.X branch, I don't want the artifacts generated by the CI bots to be named 0.16b1 to avoid confusion.
but the artifacts are only generated for tags, right?
Our current configuration on appveyor generates them continuously for everything and they get uploaded on to http://windows-wheels.scikit-learn.org . But we never documented that URL publicly until now. It's just useful to help us automate the releases.
What I would like to have is all tags get uploaded to http://wheels.scipy.org (both OSX and windows wheels) while development wheels (without tags) get uploaded to a separate container (e.g. http://wheels-dev.scikit-learn.og or something).
but never found the time to do so so far.
BTW, I fixed the wheelhouse-uploader bug under Python 2. If you want to try again:\n```\npip install -U wheelhouse-uploader\ncd /path/to/scikit-learn\npython setup.py fetch_artifacts\n```
today is my meeting day, don't expect much ;)
Hi @amueller, I fixed a bug in @larsmans PR #4157 to optimize DBSCAN. It works great in my experiment. If we merge it quickly, I would like to get it in 0.16.
since `svd_flip` is public, do you also want `_deterministic_vector_sign_flip` to be made public too, or I'll leave it as such?
keep it private
svd_flip should probably not have been private in the first place.
BTW it's probably better to have this kind of specific technical discussions in the comment threads of the issue itself rather than on gitter
Thanks! and yes sure!
we screwed up with the GSOC registration. I didn't remember you had to fill in melange and the form :-/
yeah I forgot as well and I have missed many GSoC related emails...
more importantly, we were not listed on the PSF page. we are now, as I filled out the form as mod
 @ogrisel should we wait for larsmans to pull your changes for the DBSCAN
I would like to review the dtype=object comment first.
check why this is necessary, it's not clear to me
I can explain
before, when all the points had the same number of neighbors, an array of dtype int with shape (n_samples, n_neibhors) was returned.
sorry (n_samples, n_neighbors, n_features) I guess (because the points are returned)
ok, so indeed it can be simplified now that all the neighbors models are consistent in that regard.
for actual data, that never happens and was an annoying special case in the API. Normaly an array of dtype object with shape (n_samples,) is returned
I will simplify it in my branch
Also I would have liked to get the opinion of @kno10 w.r.t. my last comments on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4334 before merging by rebased #4157.
btw, if you have any time, https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4286 (polynomial features) is also ripe for merge
ok, let's wait for @kno10 but I think the cython version looks good.
yeah that was on my todo list but go side tracked by Inria related activities
I agree on the cython version
happens. I gotta do taxes and NYU stuff today, too. I did some review or the t-SNE
I'm a bit bummed no-one wants to review the decision_function for the sparse SVC ^^
did you see that yaroptik reported the OMPCV error on many debian machines?
I will asked @scharron to add a comment to report that he tested your PR successfully.
who is that?
> did you see that yaroptik reported the OMPCV error on many debian machines?\n\nYes, I did not have the time to look into it further. So this is a real problem, and not just for travis (we have the check_skip_travis skip for that ATM).
IMO it's not a high priority issue though as I don't know anybody who runs sklearn on 32bit linux.
is travis 32 bit?
it could be useful in mobile phones but not sure the OMPCV is that useful on an android phone anyway :)
On the GSoC page I think we should have a proposal for general speed and memory improvements throughout the code base
I prefer GSoC projects that contributes many small improvements rather a big monolithic chunk of code
but we would need to identify chunks of code that are both useful and lack optimization
one the one hand I agree, because it makes it easier to review / merge parts.
on the other hand, that might make it harder for the student to focus, and also they have to dig through a lot of code
There are a lot of places were we are not efficient. For example RFECV and univariate selection, ARD
someone could pick up my old elkans k-means
the focus issue is a good point. It worked well with @MechCoder and Hamzeh though.
Arguably the GSoC topic of @MechCoder was more well-defined (improve the penalized linear models algorithms)
I wasn't very present, so I can't say how well it worked. I'd take your word for it ;)
If we give a somewhat definite list, maybe with priorities or temporal sequence, the focus might be less of an issue
what was the virtual machine you usually use for testing?
I don't remember, @kastnerkyle did those tests IIRC.
Ah you mean in general?
Most of the time I used docker (hence I cannot test 32 bit linux stuff as my host kernel is 64 bit). Otherwise I use rackspace for windows tests.
on my mac I use boot2docker with virtualbox
I think it's a 64 bit linux kernel as well.
It's possible to use vagrant / virtualbox to test 32bit linux stuff though,.
vagrant was the one I wast trying to think of
I always forget the name
reproduced it
once. I could reproduce the ompcv failure once. Great.
thanks for the dbscan merge
I added a what's new entry and did the backport to 0.16.X for the cythonized DBSCAN
saw it. sweet.
so you want to do the backports directly? There might have been other things to backport
I think it's a great feature for 0.16. Based on feedback from various startup people, DBSCAN is very useful to clean geo data.
I already cherry-picked the cython DBSCAN to 0.16.X.
If you have other fixes / optim that have been merged to master, feel free to cherry-pick them to 0.16.X.
We need to keep the what's new entry consistent between the 2 branches (master and 0.16.X though). It can be a hassle at times.
There were a couple of doc improvements that we could include in the release. I'll cherry pick them
the OVR decision function might also be good, as then we don't change behavior between releases
I am off now. See you tomorrow.
alright. good night :)
ran the test 100k times, no issue. run ``make`` three times, reproduces.
I FIXED IT :beers:
there is and \if scipy.__version__ >= 0.12\ in the code. And we wonder why we can't reproduce....
Too close scrutiny :D\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9487348/6697615/cf03f120-cd17-11e4-9742-c629d3bf8b57.png)\n
Why does this doctest failure come up randomly? - https://travis-ci.org/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/jobs/54779847 (I think I saw it somewhere else too)
this is not doctests, it is tests
and why do you think it is randomly?
it says mixture of tabs and spaces
which is plausible because I edited it in some just set up virtual machine
ok gotta run. should be fixed now
Ah... must be my mistake :) bye :)
Can anyone explain to me how to implement Affinity Propogation in Map/Reduce? http://www.chinacloud.cn/upload/2015-01/15011111364805.pdf
I don't really understand the paper
and the English is pretty much well... chinese :P
scikit-learn is not a community of mapreduce users so I doubt you will get good feedback on here. You might rather ask on a discussion forum with spark or mahout users. I am not sure that using the hadoop mareduce API is a good thing for iterative machine learning anyway. It's probably better to build upon higher level parallel construct like allreduce or the spark API in general.
The thing is that I have a huge dataset and I don't want to use K-Means since that means I have to guess the optimal number of clusters each time
Also if you still want to ask questions about the paper on a discussion forum, you should ask specific questions, otherwise you probably won't get any interesting answer.
I have no idea where to start
How do I adapt the existing algorithm to be parallel?
Use minibatch kmeans on a subset with init_size=int(1e4) and batch_size=int(1e3)
I'm not much of an ML guy but I'm trying to learn
if you are trying to learn, start with smaller datasets (e.g. a random subset) where algo run fast. To learn stuff you will have to fail many times to learn from your mistakes. If each failures take days of cluster programming and execution you will learn slowly :) By working on a subset that fits in memory on your laptop you will learn much faster.
But working on a subset of the data is meaningless
I can't even work on 10,000 nodes
Also your clustering will fail not because of the algorithm but because of the way you extract features and fail to normalize them, see for instance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC5cKYBZAeI
> I can't even work on 10,000 nodes\n\nWhat are \nodes\?
> But working on a subset of the data is meaningless\n\nI am not sure about that. If you are \not much of an ML guy\ start with a smaller / simpler problem first.
I asked our ML guy. Working with 10,000 data points is meaningless in my context
nodes = data points in the matrix
minibatch kmeans can work with millions of high dimensional points, as long as they fit in memory
init_size is just a parameter for the subset used to initialize the centroids
But I still have to optimize the number of clusters
you will have to do that anyway, whatever the algorithm
there is always at least one hyperparameter that controls directly or indirectly the number of clusters
As far as I understand AF figures that out
it does something by default that might or might not reflect what you expect to be a \good\ number of clusters
I'm working with geolocation data (x, y)
I think that eucelidian distances is a good choice
but hyperparameters such as \preference\ in the scikit-learn implementation of AP will impact the clustering outcome
yes +1 for euclidean distance for geo data.
How many samples?
200 milion
If you use scikit-learn master you might want to try DBSCAN on a 1M subset with eps the distance in meters of two points that are close enough to be considered part of a common cluster (assuming x and y are meters as well)
the implementation of DBSCAN in sklearn 0.15.2 will be much to slow.
x & y are coordinates
affinity propagation is not a great method imho. people rarely use it in practice I think, in particular not on such large data
dbscan or birch or any other method that selects the number of clusters are much likelier candidates
> x & y are coordinates\n\nI understand, but which unit? meters, km, miles, GPS degrees?
GPS degrees
they decide how much GPS degrees should be considered close points. Start with lower values to generate smaller clusters.
Birch is probably a good candidate as well if you want to compress your 200M points into a smaller summary dataset.
btw @ogrisel if you have the time, it would be awesome if you could work through some of the MRG + 1 PRs. There is a ton of them
But it's probably harder to use correctly.
@amueller alright.
otherwise we keep duplicating fixes
It's 200M unique points
That's why I was looking at map/reduce
```\n>>> 200e6 * 2 * 8 / 1e9\n3.2\n```\n\n3.2GB of double precision floats => it fits in memory
minibatch kmeans and birch can eat it
AF raises MemoryError
yes AF is not scalable
Unless you're able to run it on multiple nodes which makes it scalable
I am pretty sure that minibatch kmeans will converge in less than an hour
@omerzimp why are you so set on AF?
try on 1M first, look at the results (plot the clusters of on map)
Because I like automatic things :P
it is a lot less automatic than any of the other methods
And I really want to learn to apply ML on M/R
it's not automatic, it's lying to you
it is really hard to tune
k=10 for KMeans is as automatic as preference=median for AP
all clustering algorithms have parameters that influence the number of clusters. some are explicit, like k-means, some are implicit, as in mean-shift, dbscan and birch.
only AF has the most non-intuitive parametrization of the implicit assumptions
and sometimes you have \natural\ clusters at differrent scales (nested clusters)
in your data
so there is no \true\ / \good\ number of clusters
That's why the presented AF M/R is hierarchical
yeah I think it is rare that you have a single scale. either there are clusters on multiple levels or none at all ;)
the good number depends on what kind of application you want to use the result of the clustering for
there is also AgglomerativeClustering, which is much faster and easier to understand than AF
and provides a hierarchical clustering
AF also has a hierarchical version but not in sklearn
but is probably not scalable to 200MB unless you impose neighbors constraints which will be similar to DBSCAN or Birch
I am just asking why you want AF.
even if you run it on multiple nodes?
no, but for 200M points x 2D it's probably overkill to use a cluster
Because I have a paper on it that explains (somewhat) how to implement it in M/R which is something that I want to be able to understand and implement
The number will increase and we have other jobs executing with even more data
but you can use the spark MLlib clustering implementations if you really want to use a cluster
well ok if your point is to understand how to implement AF on MR then go for that. I just don't see why you would want to do that, as AF is a crappy algorithm.
There are a also papers about implementing good clustering algorithms on MR
do not focus on MR, they are better ways to distribute machine learning on a cluster: spark and the H20 runtime
http://mahout.apache.org/ : even mahout is moving away from mapreduce: 25 April 2014 - Goodbye MapReduce\n\nThe Mahout community decided to move its codebase onto modern data processing systems that offer a richer programming model and more efficient execution than Hadoop MapReduce. Mahout will therefore reject new MapReduce algorithm implementations from now on. We will however keep our widely used MapReduce algorithms in the codebase and maintain them.\n\nWe are building our future implementations on top of a DSL for linear algebraic operations which has been developed over the last months. Programs written in this DSL are automatically optimized and executed in parallel on Apache Spark.\n\nFurthermore, there is an experimental contribution undergoing which aims to integrate the h20 platform into Mahout.
We're using Druid over here
And the jobs are written in python. Not java
@amueller I merged @lesteve's PR with doc fixes. I have to catch my bus. Will probably reconnect later tonight.
spark and h20 are JVM stuff as well. But it's a detail in practice. What matters is how the memory is used, how the algo scales and can it be efficiently be distributed on a cluster or not.
I know spark
I haven't written anything that uses it yet
We got disco and druid over here
@ogrisel cool :) there are sooo many reviews to be done.... 
There's much better python support there
I'm trying AgglomerativeClustering on 10k points to see what happens in comparance to K-MEANS
@ogrisel Do you know a Python library that is similar to mahout?
btw @ogrisel if we merge one Pr every day, we will still be going at Chrismas (if no-one opens any more).
omerzimp there is none. Pyspark is the closest, I'd think. there are also python interfaces for h2o and graphlab/dato
I already have Druid (druid.io) and pydruid
I'm talking about a batched implementation of ML algos in Python that integrates with tools like spark or druid
I can adapt spark to druid
@ogrisel I tried AgglomerativeClustering and I can't find where to fetch the cluster centers from
np.unique(clustering.labels_)
I only get the cluster numbers
```\nIn [34]: np.unique(ac.labels_)\nOut[34]: \narray([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,\n       17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,\n       34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50,\n       51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67,\n       68, 69])\n```
k means has an attribute that contains the cluster centers
@amueller Can you explain what I'm looking at right now?
`ac.labels_` gives you the cluster membeship of each sample (row) in the matrix `X` with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`, in your case `n_features==2`
`AgglomerativeClustering` has no notion of center. The clusters can have non-convex (e.g. folded) shapes.
Same for `DBSCAN` (and `Birch` to some extent).
(Minibatch) k-means makes the convex clusters assumption, hence the cluster centers are meaningful and computed by default.
Although whatever the clustering algorithm you can always compute the center of mass of any cluster a posteriori with basic numpy operations:\n```python\ncenter_of_cluster_42 = X[ac.labels_ == 42].mean(axis=0)\n```\nassuming `X` is a numpy array.
Btw, AF also has no notion of centers ;)
hurray, thanks for merging the OMP fix @ogrisel. I'm quite confident that it is the right fix, but only time will actually tell ^^
It's no big deal if it fails though. We can still re-add the travis skip as a temporary fix.
I was confused by all the commits showing up twice in my notifications, but just realized they are for the two branches ^^
Merging this one soon will probably also help: #4370 not sure if it needs two reviews, it is just removing deprecated stuff
Just don't backport it ;)
btw, did we set a date for 0.16?
I guess 0.16.0
Hey which do you feel is better? `if n is not None` or `if n`?
they are different. If you want to ask \if n is not None\ you should do that.
the second one will also be false if n is 0
Ah! explicit is always better as usual :) thanks!!
@ogrisel @amueller could you kindly take a look at this comment - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4294#issuecomment-83123205 - This stands in the way of completion of the rest of the PR...
No official date for 0.16.0 but maybe we could target next thursday?
fine with me
@ragv currently the PR doesn't yet use the new method in the GridSearchCV etc, right? Isn't that the big thing to do for that PR?
from the 30th of March to April 1st we have a team retreat at work so I won't be able to work on the release. Then there is the oreilly webcast & PyData Paris and it would be great to have it released at that time.
I agree. lets do next thursday (the 26th)
@amueller Oh! I haven't touched `grid_search.py` :/ Thanks! I'll work on that for now :)
have you fixed cross_val_score?
and make sure to keep them backward compatible with custom CV objects people might have written
I also commented on you question in the issue
Not yet! Thanks a lot!! :) and okay sure! ( Sorry for pestering :p )
@amueller off to the movie theater to watch citizenfour. Will resume PR reviews tomorrow morning a bit, otherwise Friday. See you!
thanks, that's awesome! have fun!
I'll try to figure out the test that crashes on all kind of weird combinations of python and numpy
@amueller I was also chanting while standing on one leg, and waving burning sage around during the test passes, not sure if that's relevant.
thanks for your extensive investigation, this one is .... interesting
/play bezos
damn, would have been to good if that worked
the selection of sounds supported by campfire is great: http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/
haha. yeah no problem. i can investigate more, but having two systems that build without failing is nice too
Well if you want, you can try to track down what are the changes in python and numpy that cause this to fail ;)
I have to work on organizational stuff for the rest of the day, so I can't track this down much further at the moment
i was skimming through python's change log and nothing stood out. will take a more in depth glance at both this evening.
just if you have nothing better to do ;) I'm not sure about how to move forward. It seems strange that it works with the much older version on travis and not with the newer versions. What you could do is create a virtualenv with the travis 2.6 version of python and numpy and see if that also fails for you
ill try to do that on the linux box tonight. 
btw @ogrisel is there a reason not to enable OS X with travis?
to enable OSX on travis we would need to adapt our CI script, but it should be doable.
how do I plot AgglomerativeClustering correctly?
@omerzimp are you looking for dendograms? https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/3464 or what do you want to plot?
I have a scatter plot
I want to show where the clusters are and color them according to the number of data points in a cluster
what do you mean by where the clusters are? A common way to plot a clustering is to plot he points and color by cluster membership
That's exactly what I want but I want to rate them in green shades, yellow shades and red shades according to the number of data points in a cluster
or so what is the question? how to get the right colors?
yes
I don't know how to get the number of data points in a cluster
you can get the number of clusters by np.bincount(agg.labels_)
I need the number of datapoints in a cluster
Yep that works
why does it work
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.bincount.html
and a label is the cluster number in this case?
thanks. It's pretty accurate
How come the results are very similar to K-MEANS?
Also I still don't understand where the cluster centers are
there are no cluster centers in agglomerative clustering
Ok that's good to know
How do I check if a value would end up in a cluster? I have predict in K-MEANS but not in agglomerative clustering
@amueller Is there a parallel version of agglomerative clustering? I see that K-MEANS has one that uses joblib
the k-means uses joblib just to parallelize the restarts. there is no parallel version of agglomerative clustering, but it should be pretty fast
the way the clustering is constructed there is not really a way to predict in agglomerative clustering, but you could assign clusters to new points using nearest neighbors for example
I've seen papers about parallelizing them
@amueller See http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kb/publications/irt08.pdf
Clause 3.3
this seems to be somewhat tricky...
but doable right?
which version? they talk about the locally oriented version which is described in a different paper
Both are parallelizable according to 3.3
yes but they don't say how
You have to look at other papers
I could but I have other things to do. and without looking at it, how should I say if it is doable?
@amueller ... you around? should i also update `y_numeric` for https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/kernel_ridge.py#L144 and https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/linear_model/stochastic_gradient.py#L868 ? Both are explicitly regressors. there's a couple others that use fit between classifiers and regressors too... gbm, adaboost, bagging... Not sure I want to touch them for 0.16 though, would be more involved than a +1/-1 change
presumably all of the above get through tests somehow though...
nm. i copied these questions to the PR. you can comment there if you like, but i think those do not call the offending np function
if the tests pass, I don't think we need to do anything
thanks for all the merges @ogrisel :)
as a thank you, I pinged you in 4 other issues ^^
K. Well #4422 should be good then. It passes all tests locally on 1.8.0 
thanks, looks good and I marked for backport
that will save us some eror reports on the new release!
Hey :) @ogrisel @amueller Could I take up \Multiple metric support for cross-validation and gridsearches\ as my GSoC project...? Sorry for the delay in my proposal... Final semester takes up a lot of my time :| I chose that since so far no one has proposed for the same and also I am working on a related PR...
yes, that would be good and could also tie into finishing up the cross-validation stuff you are working on
btw does anyone remember a PR adding more git rebase docs to the developer documentation?
I though someone did it but I can't find it any more
\git rebase docs\ you mean contributor docs??
docs for the contributors on how to do git magic, like rebasing, not merging in master, and squashing
we were talking about that somewhere (ML? issues?) and I though someone made PR. but maybe that was just wishful thinking
apparently today is minor doc fix day. third push to master in a row.
@ogrisel in a recent PR you posted \only 202 PRs to go\. Now it's 227. GSoC I guess ;) And that even with pretty aggressive merging...
(shamefully) Thats me :p Joel had posted an issue asking for a better contributor docs... I am still doing that :| btw I did update wiki with a neat tree outlining the structure of our improved contributors guide... https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/Contributors-Guide
Something I spend way too much time doing when writing new stuff, or figuring out what's happening in an existing method (and perhaps there's already an easy way that this dum dum doesn't know)... But would adding the actual source code file in which a given developer func is located to the sklearn.utils.x functions' docstrings be helpful?
(only for non-public functions in utils I think)
trevorstephens: psource should give you the source in ipython
that is magical... thx! but doesnt seem to tell the file it's in. :-/
You could also do a `git grep \def function_name\` right? Thats the easiest I think! :)
for the file you can use function.__file__
that is ``function.__file__``
__file__ didnt work, but func.__code__ seems to get what i want. thanks!
that is `func.__code__`
it might be that __file__ only works for modules, not functions
psource should give you the same as file
err code
Given that there is a huge interest among students in learning about ML, do you think it would be within the scope of/beneficial to skl to have all the exercises and/or concepts, from a good quality book (ESL / PRML / Murphy) or an academic course like NG's CS229 (not the less rigorous coursera version), implemented using sklearn? Or perhaps we could instead enhance our tutorials and examples, to be a self study guide to learn about ML?\nI was planning to include this in my GSoC proposal... does it seem like an useful idea?\n(Also is this a correct place to discuss this or the Mailing list might be better for such questions?)
Or would it be better if I simply add more examples?
Yes please! 
I really want to learn ML and it's pretty hard as it is
An extensive tutorial would be lovely. 
Thanks for the response!! Lets wait for a confirmation from the core devs, since any additional code does come with its own maintenance cost... They would be the best at judging if that additional maintenance is worth the benefit it offers :)
> Also is this a correct place to discuss this or the Mailing list might be better for such questions?\n\nNM! I've copied this to the ML, so as to reach a wider audience :) Please let me know your views there!
@ragv +1 for a GSoC on cross-validation improvements. I can volunteer to be a mentor on that one.
Thanks!! :D would you be able to take a look at my proposal at https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/GSoC-2015-Proposal:-Multiple-metric-support-for-CV-and-grid_search-and-other-general-improvements and let me know your views?
will do.
@ragv I don't know about NG's course, but for the books, sklearn is useless for the exercises, right? They are mostly mathematical proofs. How would sklearn help with that?
@ragv I think we should focus your GSoC on improving cross-val, writing a generic tutorial to ML is interesting but too long to do in addition to a GSoC
for the cross-val, we could have the data-independent refactoring and then for the second part of the GSoC experiment with high level helper API to do out-of-core cross-validation for models that support partial_fit
I thought we wanted to do multiple metrics?
I have personally not started to thing about what such an API would look like but I think this is an important use case
multiple metrics is interesting as well
btw have you looked at any of the gsoc proposals yet?
but https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4294 should definitely be part of the GSoC
just https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/wiki/GSoC-2015-Proposal:-Multiple-metric-support-for-CV-and-grid_search-and-other-general-improvements
I guess I need to review them all...
btw, @ogrisel I thought about doing the split of the ``utils`` module into the private and public modules, that people have been talking about for ever. What do you think about that?
Hey all, I have noticed [here](http://sourceforge.net/p/scikit-learn/mailman/message/24403926/) and [here](http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/scipy-dev/2010-January/013709.html) that there was once a genetic algorithm module in scikits.learn, it appears to have been removed mostly due to code rot, maybe API differences too, but does anyone know if there is an underlying general issue with genetic algorithms that are not scikit-learn friendly? 
For context, I am writing a symbolic regression class that constrains genetic programming's flexibility to the main use cases found in scikit-learn (regression, classification, transformation) and sticks with the existing scikit-learn API style. So just wanted to check in to ensure I'm not going off the deep end as I'm nearing a functional regressor already... Though still a fair ways from a PR :smile: 
@ogrisel green button on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4432/files to avoid merge conflicts?
@trevorstephens genetic algorithms are probably going off the mariana trench. what is your application of symbolic regression?
haha. what do you mean by application? where would it be used?
its just a regressor, except that the final result is expressed as a non-linear equation.
could also be used for automated feature extraction in a supervised transformer
basic idea is to take an initial sample of random equations and apply genetic operations such as mutation, reproduction, etc to the fittest individuals in a population. the equations are expressed like LISP trees... well im just using python lists, but similar structure
@amueller about the split of utils I have no strong opinions. I am +1 on introducing new private utils with a `_` prefix.
Ok you are just building a regressor. By application I mean: does this ever work better than a random forest? Also, is that what people currently use in symbolic regression? And does that work better than greedy expansions of variables in a linear model?
@ogrisel would you still have them in the ``.utils`` module? I thought about introducing ``._utils`` and just moving (backward-compatible) all the non-public API there?
but maybe I should rather spend my time on reviewing the LDA and GP PRs  or finishing the MLP.
Btw, for the MLP, I'm not 100% certain on how to do nesterovs momentum. I find the paper was not very clearly written, but maybe I was just tired
ive seen people using symbolic regression in combination with stacking on kaggle (the higgs boson comp was memorable) to extract new features that helped their gbm's latch onto some very interesting segments of the feature space. there is a lot of research into competitive results though i dont know if they have been compared to RFs
\Also, is that what people currently use in symbolic regression?\ do you mean LISP trees? yes, it is very common. basically a flattened tree representation
@amueller about the MLP PR, I have implemented an adaptative schedule for the learning rate here: https://github.com/ogrisel/scikit-learn/commit/3c4cc13b39fdb6a91be44a0977766e16d45ed5dc . It seems to be very useful in practice, although Ilya Sutskever recommends to use a validation set instead of the training score. Using a validation set is complicated from an API point of view though.
Nesterov momentum is not that complicated. Have you read:  http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/momentum.pdf ?
it's mostly the ordering of the update.
@amueller this experimental notebook might help http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ogrisel/notebooks/blob/master/Gradient.ipynb
also I am currently experimenting with a from scratch implementation in theano to have a comparision point (and more NN experience): http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ogrisel/notebooks/blob/master/representations/MNIST%20experiments.ipynb
about the utils stuff it does not seem to be particularly high priority to me but feel free to work on that if you find it important yourself.
I read the momentum pdf. but I'll have a look at your notebook. I feel we should merge this asap as it has been lying around for so long. adding monitoring etc can always be done afterwards
and the use of a validation set would be great but is a whole other can of worms
@trevorstephens sorry for being ambiguous. I meant are people using genetic programming for symbolic regression.
I am not sure we should merge that early. The optimizer is clearly suboptimal, the one in my branch seems to be much more robust but changes the meaning of the 'constant' hyperparameter.
I think it's very important to have a robust hyperparameter by default.
But I want to focus on the 0.16 release first.
@trevorstephens encourage you to implement that as a third party project first. If it proves empirically useful then we might consider it for inclusion in the future. But Genetic Programming stuff is culturally very different from the sklearn spirit. Especially we do not want to have a generic Evoluationary Algorithm module as part of sklearn as the API would not be suited for it.
A black box Genetic programming solver hidden in a SymbolicRegressor estimator might be interesting though.
but it's utility would have to be proven first. So better implement that in a dedicated python package first.
@ogrisel is there much to do for 0.16?
@ogrisel is there anything to be done for the EML branch? It has no +1 yet.
this one would be nice: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4350
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4436 just passed
@amueller @ogrisel Thanks for the reviews!! Based on your comments I'll replace that section of my prop. with a more significant work\n> They are mostly mathematical proofs. How would sklearn help with that?\n\nI was thinking more on the lines of http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/code.html.. But like you said for the practical part of it, we do have some nice books! Perhaps out of GSoC, it would  be better if I simply cleaned up existing examples and added a few more perhaps!\n
@amueller , yes, it is the 'classic' use of GP. 
@ogrisel . \A black box Genetic programming solver hidden in a SymbolicRegressor estimator might be interesting though.\ Yep. That's exactly what I'm going after. Though understand if you don't want it in the package yet, makes perfect sense.
FWIW, here's the (did I mention super-early) code: https://github.com/trevorstephens/scikit-learn/blob/genetic_programming/sklearn/genetic.py
running is as simple as `gp = SymbolicRegressor(random_state=415)`  `gp.fit(diabetes.data, diabetes.target)`  `print gp.program_`
@amueller I am working on pinpointing numpy version issues for #3747 at the moment
ho you merged it already.
Did you do the backport as well ?
I am not sure about the 1.9 version comparison in the test
I am testing with numpy 1.8.0
Ok the tests pass with 1.8 as well :)
@trevorstephens would be great to extract that as a new library. You can write some sklearn compat tests with stuff in`sklearn.utils.estimator_checks`.
you can make it easy to install by writing a simple setup.py.
As you don't need compiled extensions, you don't need the complicated numpy.distutils, you can just use the regular distutils or setuptools.
you could name your project symbolicregressor or something
symregressor
billie-gene has a nice ring to it
@ragv I would move generic tutorial out of the scope of your GSoC but you can expand the documentation item of your GSoC proposal to include a tutorial on how to do proper cross-validation: how to select the CV strategy for a given problem, how to use stratification, how to check that the i.i.d. assumption is not violated...
thanks for the advice as well @ogrisel 
@ogrisel Thanks for the suggestion! On it :) Do the other sections look okay...?
I have to go now, I will review the other sections and give you finer feedback tomorrow
Okay! bye :)
@ogrisel the thing about the mlp is, that as long as it is a PR, we will not get feedback about it from anyone. But once it is merged, people will use it, and people will sent PRs. I don't think we need to \nail it\ before it is merged. The naive end-user will only use it after the release
That seems like a good idea... More after merging to master, it becomes easier for anyone to contribute to it by a normal PR rather than a PR to a PR... (for whatever my comment is worth) +1 from me for that! :)
also, if it is not considered convoluted, we could raise a `BetaModule` warning like `DeprecationWarning` to warn users not to use it in production code?
well, if it is the dev version, people should know
I have the common tests on OneClassSVM (I think) hanging randomly on my box. no good.
@amueller Should #1674 be closed in favor of #1626, since @mblondel has been positive about the same in his last comment?
which comment?
https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/1674#issuecomment-13982364
well he said he understood my idea
not that it solves his issue / replaces his
I should reread my proposal
It has been two years (sic!)
Well.. I thought of including it in my proposal ;) I feel this is a tough one and will take easily around 1.5 months? (Is that adequate amount of time that could be allocated for the same?)
I would have to re-read but it tries to address some of the points that I mentioned in my email
Yea :) please take your time... I'll just put it tentatively as 1.5 months for now... but you'd know better, given my previous work and my 8hr a day schedule... :)
the main question would be how to pass it the validation set so to make it pipeline compatible and GridSearchCV compatible
any GSOC applicant looking for stuff to do can check: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/4442#issuecomment-85683185
(ragv you have enough contribs and don't need to worry about it ;)
not that help would not be appreciated, but I think you have enough stuff to do
LOL okay :D I am a bit busy this month due to my academics moreover, thats why I am not able to spend enough time on scikit-learn  :cry:
@ragv have you put you proposal on melange?
I cannot find it
if so please edit the title to add \scikit-learn\ in it
Sure! I haven't yet... I was fine tuning it a bit.. sorry :)
I think it's better to put it on melange early so that we can comment on it and read each others comments
you can still edit it afterwards
I am doing that now... sorry for the delay :)
@ogrisel Done! but the formatting is awefully bad... A little more description is needed too... I'll fix both ASAP :)
Is \path algorithms\ a good name to mean all cv related objects?
no
wait, depends on what you mean by cv related objects
It applies to LinearModelCV objects
cross_validation / learning_curve / model_selection etc... oh.. sorry then I'll call them CV objects simply :)
anyhow, I commented on melange that I think it is not a good name
I would just call it model selection and evaluation maybe
Does this seem okay? - \scikit-learn: Enhance cross validation and related modules.\
I think you will have a great proposal. I haven't read your most recent version, I just wanted to reiterate that you should try to focus, in particular provide concrete deliverables
sound more appropriate than the current title.
sorry if my feedback today is a bit short, I am feeling sick and wanted to at least briefly comment on all submission
Not an issue at all! Feel free to comment whenever you feel like :) And more over I got the basic idea and hence can work out my proposal according to your guidelines :)\nAlso take care :) Sorry to trouble you at the last min... 
haha well we just started to review now so it is our fault ;)
+1 on the new title and focus
I at least gave some cursory comments on all proposals. I think all the mentors should review at least one that they are interested in.
@ogrisel do you want to put your name on one or more proposals on the list (more than one meaning one of these will be selected)
@amueller you mean in the google doc or on melange?
google doc
@ogrisel do you think this is a good idea: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/4445 we could ask cangermueller to do it, he didn't have much opportunity to prove his coding skills yet, I think
heading over to facebook for free drinks now ^^
ok I did a pass on the GSoC proposals. I need to go to sleep now. Tomorrow will be very busy with meetings and meetups.
I will probably be back online on Thursday morning to resume work on GSoC reviews and sklearn 0.16 release.
I might cherry-pick some more things today, I have to check
@amueller do you think we should probably fine tune landscape settings to avoid reporting not-so-useful fixes that are probably ignored... Thing is without it raising red flags only for important issues that a core dev would normally frown upon (like PEP8, imports, the docstring format), I am afraid this will eventually be ignored like the coveralls bot. :/ WDYT?
the main problem is that it reports new problems that are not related to the code at all.
Ah... We'll then just wait for it to get better ;)
@ogrisel do you think there is a chance @GaelVaroquaux will review and / or put his name next to some of the proposals? It would be nice to have tentative mentors.
@ogrisel I backported some doc fixes and the faster polynomial features
Will I be able to edit my prop after 27th? :p 
I don't think so. the mentors might
but you should not count on it ;)
Seems like a more handy place to discuss stuff.
Indeed, looks great!
So, about the CI system again... I think jitpack is a completely wrong approach. The purpose of a CI system should be to provide a new jar build whenever a change is made to the source code. First of all, this way users can get bug fixes and new features as soon as possible and secondly, it can provide quite a bit of instant feedback to us when we code. I'm thinking of immediately noticing new compiler errors or warnings or checkstyle issues.
The one thing I fear about using AppVeyor is that it's not centered on building java applications, so we might run into some situations where AppVeyor simply can't provide all the appropriate tools. That's why I would probably prefer a CI solution using or based on Jenkins. Jenkins is centered on Java and Maven, has a huge and active user base and I actually have some experience with it ^^. Doesn't mean that we can't give AppVeyor a shot, though!
I don't understand the problem with jitpack. Make some code, commit, make a github release tag when stable, and people can use it in maven without us having to build anything at all.
anyway, you do what you want :)
We should compile the project whenever a commit is pushed, not just when we want to release.
We wouldn't need a CI system if the only thing we were to do with it is build releases.\nA CI system should provide *continuous* integration. Users should not be restricted to the exact builds we mark as releases.\nBasically the pinnacle of \Release-Early-Release-Often\
By the way, you have to take a look at this :D\nhttp://ci.stutzfam.ch/job/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API/javadoc/com/github/theholywaffle/teamspeak3/TS3Api.html
You see, in the few issues that popped up on the project, I'd have loved to be able to say\n\Yeah, we're not quite ready for a next release because I still need to improve X and rewrite another class, but in the meantime, you can just configure maven to use the newest snapshot build\\nThat's what CI does and that's where it comes in really useful: providing builds between releases. It also enables us to get immediate feedback from users when we fix their issues; they can download the newest snapshot and try it out without having to set up a build space and compile the API by themselves.
Actually, you already have travisCI set up, so with some hacking we might actually be able to have travis upload builds to your MacGyver-style github repository and publish javadocs to the gh_pages branch
There's a maven goal in the pom that copies all files from /html to /apidocs, but the directory /html doesn't exist and is never generated.\nThus, this goal will never execute. Is it safe to remove this or do you just have this directory locally?\nSorry for the message spam, by the way :/
It was originally meant for uploading javadocs to gh pages, along with the artifacts to the mvn branch. But it's not really an apropiate method. So yeah, a CI where people can grab jars themselves sounds good but people should also be able to get it through maven somehow. 
Maybe apply for a slot at sonatype. I've done it before for an other open source project, 
Well, a friend of mine hosts a server and I basically have all of this already set up, a [Jenkins build server](http://ci.stutzfam.ch/job/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API/) and a [sonatype nexus repository](http://repo.stutzfam.ch/index.html#welcome)
But yes, the problem is that it's not really hosted but rather self-maintained and as it's just a friend of mine who's hosting this server, I can't even guarantee that the server will still be up in X time
Wait, does Sonatype offer actual build servers with their own repository for FOSS projects?
yep, just deploy to their servers and it syncs up with central maven repository
also, can you see this https://travis-ci.org/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API ?
Yup, and I can also see that it hasn't been doing builds in a long time ^^
Did you deactivate the travis instance?
yes
reenabled it just 5 mins ago
ah kk. I read that actually, with just a bit of hacking, we could make travis also deploy the javadocs and the builds to the GitHub-repository
So we wouldn't even need a dedicated build server
http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/
That would be great to automatically add binaries to our releases. Doesn't solve the need for a real snapshot repository, though ^^
http://benlimmer.com/2013/12/26/automatically-publish-javadoc-to-gh-pages-with-travis-ci/
We could adapt something like that for our maven repo
So I think the question is: do we want to go for a \real\ CI server and move away from GitHub as a place for Javadocs and the repository or do we want to cram everything into travis and continue using GitHub as a MacGyver solution?
the first option is ofcourse the more cleaner one
Yup. I'd really like to give travis a shot as it doesn't really require any changes to our current setup, but I'm really disappointed about how unresponsive the website already feels
some big projects use it though, like RxJava
Well, yeah, but they don't use Travis to publish their build artifacts and their Javadocs ^^
I think, basically, the best solution for our project would be to have a hosted build server somewhere (if possible one that's free for FOSS :D), that has Jenkins or something similar installed (because this gives us the most customizability) and has a hosted repository service, too
I'm checking out bintray
free for open source
But I don't know if there even is something like this.\nThere's Cloudbees, but recently, they've made it extremely restrictive for FOSS and have basically re-oriented themselves towards business applications. They also used to deactivate accounts once there haven't been any commits in a week when their service was still free
ye, I don't like them either
Bintray looks like it's only for distributing actual builds of applications and not for actually building them
Might be wrong though, haven't finished checking everything out
Too complicated for me, I didn't understand their system.
Do you know if travis deploys when a commit has a tag or every single commit?
Every single commit, even every pull request, iirc
it does for builds, but deploys as well?
deploys as in?
Travis doesn't even keep the binary artifacts by itself
You already have to hack around that
Travis basically only exists to test code
and pull requests
I mean when you configure travis.yml to deploy artifacts, does it do that so with every comit or only commits with tags?
Like in the link you sent me befroe?
yes
That's only for tagged commits
But there's also [this](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/uploading-artifacts/)
Which would work for every commit
Seems to be specific to Amazon S3 though
I'm getting tired. If you have a plan let me know.
Currently, I think we have 3 options (dumping travis):\n* AppVeyor\n* codeship.com\n* The dedicated server hosted by my friend
3rd one has the benefit of already working and already being configured for the project ^^
I'd like something a little more long lasting than your friends server though
Yeah, that's the problem. Question is, what is long-lasting, all these hosted CI solutions come and go all the time, e.g. cloudbees
sonatype is the go to free maven repository
I think we should take that route
Ever thought about just using Maven Central as the repo?
but it requires opening a ticket
and gpg signing the artifacts
Is the default one for Maven projects anyways, so users wouldn't even have to add a repository to their pom
Yup
Right, you mentioned that sonatype stuff would be merged into maven central anyways
also, only one of us will be able to deploy without sharing sonatype passwords
Not if we actually have a CI system and the CI system has an OAuth token (if sonatype supports these)
Then changing the version to a string not ending in \-SNAPSHOT\ is enough to release
with travis you can set environment variables which are then placed into the pom
those variables are encrypted
too many options though, I'm going to bed
I've changed my mind, I think building on Travis-CI might just be exactly what we need. It's simple, small and works pretty reliably. I think there's something wrong with your settings though (tokens on GitHub probably), as my commits don't automatically trigger a build. I've just tested the whole system using a small project of mine, and everything works well (and it's fast as hell!).\n\nSo basically, what we need to do is...\n1. Fix the travis builds\n1. Do some scripting to\n    * deploy the built jar file from the staging repository to the GitHub repo whenever all test pass (successful build)\n    * make the build generate some kind of link pointing to the newest build artifact? Would be neat, but no idea how to do that\n    * deploy the javadocs to the gh-pages branch when all tests pass and the version is set to release (not ending in \-SNAPSHOT\)\n    * maybe disable javadoc building when it's not a release to speed up the build.\n       as Travis is shared between all open-source projects, reducing the work load on the server doesn't only benefit ourselves\n1. You need to add an OAuth token as an (encrypted) environment variable so the pushes work
Oh, Travis fixed itself. Mkay
Okay, I got the build script ready. Can you generate a deploy token for the repo and set the environment variable \OAUTH2_DEPLOY_TOKEN\ to that token? :)
I tested it out, btw. Once set, nobody can get hold of the original value of the environment variable anymore.
I give the script a 20% chance on failing at building, 50% to fail at deploying and 30% to working great at the first try ^^
sure, but where do I get such token?
Over here's a manual: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/#Authenticating-with-an-Oauth-token
I'm sorry, but I'll go offline for today. I have a splitting headache and there's still the finale of Gfinity (NiP vs EnvyUs) to watch
It's done.
Headache not as bad anymore, so let's try this out
Kay, after an initial derp, the build itself worked, but the deployment didn't. And I have no clue what's wrong ^^
Looks like we're just not using the up-to-date version of the plugin. You even commented on the issue there :D
Do you think we should also deploy the javadoc-jar to the repository for snapshot builds?
nah, I would only deploy javadoc when it's a proper release. Is it still not working?
or actually, nevermind. Just push all the artifacts
It seems to be working great, doesn't it?
You think it matters if [this](https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API/blob/mvn-repo/com/github/theholywaffle/teamspeak3-api/maven-metadata.xml) doesn't keep track of previous versions ? Because it gets overwritten everytime.
I like the changes to the readme. Looks professional with that nice travis logo :D
And about the metadata files, I noticed them, too. I think as long as the desired version is explicitly stated in the pom, it should still work. Unsure about version ranges, though. I think that we're hitting the limits of what the GitHub repo can do for us.
I think the next step would be a free sonatype repository, so we can deploy to an actual maven server instead of github :)
We might have to clone the mvn-repo branch into /mvn-repo/ first, before we run the GitHub site plugin. That way we'd keep the metadata intact, but it would slow down the build
Man you're good at message-sniping xD
Yeah, that would be the other solution, we just move away from the GitHub repo. GitHub's not intended for that stuff anyways
Oh, I just thought you reacted to my msg instantly.
I know that sonatype requires your pom to be fully correct before you can apply
Just got home, and while I was typing I got your message ^^
we're missing the maven signing plugin for that
would that work with travis?
again, as an environment variable?
I don't have any experience with that plugin, but I don't see why it wouldn't
do you mind figuring that out, I'm not so good with maven configuration
yeah, probably
kk, I'll see what I can do
do you know if maven central even accepts SNAPSHOT builds?
yes
this is an example POM of an other project of mine that is configured to deploy to sonatype: https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/League-of-Legends-XMPP-Chat-Library/blob/master/pom.xml
Hmm.. should we also manually upload older releases to the sonatype repo later?
So we maintain backwards compatibility
nah, people who use old artifacts probably don't change their pom either
so they just keep pointing to the old github mvn repo
Well, they don't have to. Maven central is the default so it would still work
Ah, yeah, we don't need to delete the GitHub repo
well if you know how to deploy older version, go ahead :D
Well, I only know that you can manually upload them to Sonatype Nexus repositories ^^
I don't assume that they use exactly the same for their Maven Central-merged public repos
I'll keep it in the pom so whenever we do a full release, the javadocs will be published in the gh-pages branch
actually, that won't be necessary any more
http://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.springframework/spring-core/4.1.5.RELEASE
it takes your maven javadocs and displays them
God damn it
That's nice
Do you have to add another entry to the POM for that to work? I'd assume so
nope
fully automatic
it just fetches from maven central base on group id and artifact id
So I guess they just de-zip the javadoc jar
You're currently using gpg:sign in the POM, but I saw there's also gpg:sign-and-deploy-file
Nevermind, that's only for single files
Btw, why are we using nexus-staging-maven-plugin instead of just the default maven deploy plugin?
emm let me check
I think we need it to verify my login
The default deploy plugin would log you in first, too, afaik
Actually, I know it does, I've already used it with credentials
I guess Sonatype just prefers it if we use their plugin because it's specially made for their repository servers ^^
I guess
it expands above the reguarl maven deploy plugin
https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-maven-plugins/tree/master/staging/maven-plugin
It also does some weird local staging stuff
Dunno if that's really necessary, but it doesn't hurt, either
but leave that for when we actually obtain a repo
right now they only have to see that we're using the signing plugin
Oh, I don't intend to switch away from their deploy plugin
As long as it works :D
Also, bye bye generating javadocs and then copying them over to /apidocs/latest/. Another small issue of mine gone ^^
also, you can add your name to the organization property of the header plugin
kk, will do
Hmmm, the gpg plugin expects GnuPG to be pre-installed
Build failed on my local machine
yep, had the same problem
let me show you my settings.xml
http://privatepaste.com/139e8f5492
I'll still have to install gpg here, though ^^
but does Travis have it?
Also, what about the \yourPassphrase\? Is that automatically generated somewhere, or do we need to use something specific?
I'll go check
If not, we could always install it
run apt-get before building
I used this guide to generate a passphrase
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html
back in the day
of deploying from my own machine
If travis actually has gpg, it's not documented
I think maven gpg plugin will work straight out of the box with travis
from looking at other projects that use the plugin
Let's hope so :)
Ah, wonderful. Then it's just not documented. Or I didn't find the complete list of installed programs
Wonderful, I even got to kick the hideous profiles out of the pom again
actually a passphrase is optional
when creating gpg keys
Cool, even better then ^^
How should I call the environment variables for username and password?
OSSRH_USERNAME
Is there no way to use some kind of OAuth token for that? It seems kind of sloppy to me that one would have to use a raw username and password combination
Especially for the system Sonatype uses, which even requires GPG signatures
I've looked but found nothing
all guides use username and password
have you downloaded GnuGP?
Not yet, was still busy modifying the build scripts
Do I even need it?
I guess it would be good for testing
You need it because the keys that are generated have to be shared with the MIT key server
which is also done through that tool
I'm slightly confused right now ^^
Read this guide completely
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/working-with-pgp-signatures.html
I guess I'll have to. My understanding of GPG is still limited ^^
Should I really generate a keypair that never expires? The guide tells me to just take the default values, but that seems a bit sloppy to me
Wait a second, shouldn't we just use your GPG key for the signing?
I'm confused now too
travis needs to get the key file to sign, right?
Welcome to the world of asymmetric encryption :D
I would think so, yes
But why would it need both mine and your key ?
It needs only one key
but Travis doesn't store keys
Environment variable again? :P
Oh god that smiley
What have I done
So, I generated a key for testing
And that worked, but
for the signing to work on Travis, it will need to have the private key and its passphrase
Because we sign it with our private key and the recipient checks the signature using our public key
I think we're looking at it wrong. 
Travis shouldn't deploy to sonatype
but we should do that ourselves, locally
in that case, we each have our own key
For every single snapshot build?
maybe there is an option
I'm not seeing it though
I'll do some google-ing
basically we have to host our GPG key file somewhere
Look at this: http://benlimmer.com/2014/01/04/automatically-publish-to-sonatype-with-gradle-and-travis-ci/
at the bottm (Publishing Releases with Travis CI)
Yup, but hosting secret GPG key files is possibly the most insecure thing to do
the text says to encrypt your file
I think that is the only way to let travis deploy for us
he somehow needs to get a hold of the key file
Yeah, that's true
As long as the passphrase is strong enough, it shouldn't be an issue
I hope
That guy in the article is doing the smart thing, he's using a dedicated Jenkins server to do the building ^^\nUnfortunately, we just cannot host any servers by ourselves
Okay, I'm basically done with the pom and the deploy script
But still no idea on how to correctly sign the artifacts
Wait a second, I think I just had a huge brainfart
Shouldn't it be like this: Travis gets the public key to sign the artifacts with from a specified keyserver and Sonatype then checks with the private key if the signature is correct?
Or does that just make the problem worse? xD
I don't even know anymore
you know what
let's just keep it with the github maven repository
Well, the solution is still far from perfect, so I think we could surely do some more tinkering with Travis.\nBut maybe just not right now ^^
So, instead of messing around with GPG, let's watch some java humor (didn't even know that existed O.o) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR1PujzQ53Q
Interesting feature, gitter :D
takes up my entire screen lol
and yeah, I've this before :)
Same here :D
You know, I had this whole essay written up about how we should probably have inheritance in the Wrapper objects, like ClientInfo should extend Client, ChannelInfo Channel and VirtualServerInfo VirtualServer. And now GitHub erased it...\nWell, anyways: I think we should have inheritance in there so a) we get more code reuse and b) users can also pass a ClientInfo for API methods that accept a Client or a Channel etc.
There are some issues though. ClientInfo has all the values Client also has, except for one single boolean flag: isClientTalking (which is apparently only transmitted with the \clientlist\ command and not \clientinfo\) :(
oh, I didn't know that
I basically forgot everything about how ts3 query works
it's been a long time for me
Finals are coming up so I haven't been having a lot of time...
But I've found something that might prove to be interesting
And also secure and trustworthy enough that we could sign our builds there
https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/
They offer free trials and FOSS can apply for a free license. Runs on their servers, so practically 0 maintenance for us
Aside from build-server stuff I've done some cleanups on the examples. Will commit them soon, still a few changes to be made.
So I made a spreadsheet to visually represent the changes I want to make to the wrapper classes\nCan be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OwiA9fC6veSedLLjuHBAXwSdRz-xSahaSxg6qpkLbyw/edit?usp=sharing\nand I'd be glad if you could tell me your opinion on it all & if there are any other changes you'd like to see made
I like the unsupported exception
you're free to implement those changes if you want :)
I've been busy myself lately and for some reason gitter doesn't send me notifications of chat messages
Did you take a look at the other sheets, too?\nI've made one for each wrapper class I want to \merge\
oh didn't see those tabs
Happens to me, too, all the time :D
The other classes are pretty straight-forward, though
yep, you're all good
I can't implement them right now, though, I'm right in the middle of writing my written final exams. Shortly followed by the oral exams -.-
how come you reacted so fast to my message?
I have my browser open (pretty much all the time) and have notifications enabled
you keep a gitter tab open all the time?
so I get a pop-up, no matter what tab I'm currently looking at
uhm, yup :D
Cause... reasons

you p^robably have lots of ram
Chrome's using 3 GB at the moment, out of 16 GB. So that's pretty okay still, all things considering

Great job Gitter....
cya in a month or 2 again :P
Same :)\nI'm gonna get back to revisiting vector geometry, statistics and calculus now. 4 hour long maths final coming up tomorrow :D
hey you guys here?
@TheHolyWaffle handled in private chat
Okay so is their an event for when the bot recieves a message?
Hey guys! Do you still frequent this? Just wanted to let you know this repo is awesome and is very well done!  I created a small pull request, do you think you could take a look at it?Thanks for creating this beautiful Java API, it will allow me to make the TS3 scripts of my wildest dreams! :-)
I've accepted your PR. Thank you for contributing ;) !
Thanks a lot! Is the newest commit deprecating getId() a clarity thing? That's the 
Oh never mind I see the comment now!
So does this break 
The example fix I did? That's the same getId() right? Sorry for the spam!
I just deprecated getId() for clarity's sake so it's clear that the client ID is meant. In Client it's clear that getId() means the client's ID, in ServerQueryInfo... not so much. What is more, it's just deprecated and not deleted, so nothing will break due to this change.\nFurthermore, I've been working on the examples myself for quite a bit. I've incorporated your fix into my offline version (thank you very much btw!), but a lot of the file is probably going to get overwritten soon-ish.\n\nWhat is more, I changed it so `api.whoAmI().getClientId()` is used to get the query's ID instead of using `api.getClientByName(\PutPutBot\).get(0).getId()`. It's nicer, requires less data transmission and is less prone to errors.
Yeah thats a good idea, I wasn't aware that whoami() returned a ServerQueryInfo, that's pretty awesome.
Is there any way to get a client by providing a unique identifier? Does it make sense to do that - I want to make sure I am referencing the correct client, not just someone with the same nickname. Even IP would be useful. Im not seeing any methods in TS3Api or Client.
https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/theholywaffle/teamspeak3/TS3Api.java#L1578
It does make sense to do that if you want to be 100% sure. You could also use database IDs, they don't change, either. Except if you're resetting the server or the client hasn't been around for a long time (90 days+ I think)\n*Never* use IPs to distinguish clients. Many ISPs have a rotating IP system, so people's IPs will change. Other than that, it's also possible for 2 separate clients to use the same internet connection, resulting in the same IP
That's why it's worth working with an IDE that has an auto-complete feature, by the way. Type in \getClient\ get \getClients()\ \getClientsByName(String)\ \getClientByNameExact(String)\ etc.
Yeah I've used eclipse and netbeans before but right now I'm using sublime text, maybe I should hop back on the ide train, this is the first time I've worked with any libraries besides the standard java ones and my own :)
Hey guys, i am new in developing with this TS3-API, but i got only 1 simple question, \nI got an 2 questions,\nFirst of all, my english skills are not the best ^^ so please dont judge me :P\n\nSecond,\nWhen i use the API and test one of the examples, it always throws a ConnectionException(Connection refused), is there any issue i had to handle or am 
i only to stupid to handle the API xD\n\nSecond question, \nIs the query bot show as an normal Client on the Server in order to get messages from the clients or is it not visible for them? \nRegards,\nAlex :) 
First of all, the examples don't work for you for two reasons:\n- You're trying to connect to the IP \77.77.77.77\\n- It's trying to log in to \serveradmin\ using the password \serveradminpassword\\nBoth the IP and the login information will vary from server to server. That's why we left example data there.\n\nThe answer to the second question, however, is both yes and no.\nUsually, clients will not be able to see any server queries. But there is a checkbox you can tick in your \Favorites\ which makes server queries visible.\nBasically, you shouldn't rely on server queries being visible to other clients. Instead, make it so your query received event notifications when a chat event is sent (using [this method](https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/theholywaffle/teamspeak3/TS3Api.java#L2720)) and then register an event handler to respond to these chat events (using [this method](https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/theholywaffle/teamspeak3/TS3Api.java#L457)).\n\nThis way your clients can interact with the query by sending messages, without having to directly interact with the \client\ in TeamSpeak itself.
Thanks for the anwsers :) \n
You're welcome! Feel free to ask again if there are any other problems.
Ok i foung my problem, i put the Initial settings for the TS3-Server like, \nTS3Config#setHost,setQueryPort, TS3Query.connect() in a own Method, i dont know why this problem occurs, but i found the solution :) \nThank you again for the Tipps :))
The only problem was, that my \Init()\ -Method wasn't static :)
Anyone here?
It appears that no matter what I try to connect to, it always throws a hostNotFound exception or something
@closedAccount well, what are you trying to connect to? :D
Sorry, unknownhostexception
Have you tried downloading the TS3 server for yourself (it's free), and connecting to localhost?
216.127.64.88:3168
Yes
and you still get a hostnotfound?
I'm connected to said server as we speak.
Wait, are you trying to actually connect on port 3168?
I've dumped that in as the host
Since you need to use that port to connect to the server
Okay, so TS3 has different ports
One (or several) for voice, one for server queries and one for file transmission
Usually, the default port for server queries is 10011, and this is also the default in this API
so, maybe try to just leave out the whole port section of the IP first
And see if you get a connection
I think I tried that but I will attempt again
\[DEBUG] [SEVERE] [ERROR] {msg=invalid parameter, id=1538}\n\
This is actually a good sign, the TS3 server is sending you an error back ^^
That means you must be connected
So, first of all after you are connected, you need to a) select a virtual server and b) log in
So you can actually do stuff on that TS server
I watched the lobby and nothing connected but I can imagine it is connecting since it is not exploding with an exception
You won't see the query in your TS3 client unless you have a setting turned on in your favorites settings
Seeing how you already know the voice port of your TS3 server, you can select the appropriate virtual server by using TS3Api.selectVirtualServerByPort(3168)
Ah I see now
I see that makes sense
And you can log in either by setting the server query username and password in the TS3Config object or by calling logIn(username, password) after you're connected
Do you already have a Server Query login?
No
Alright, let's get you one then :D
You (usually) need to be Server Admin on your server for this to work, though
One second, need to change my TS UI into English
I'm the server owner so it's fine
I really appreciate the help, by the way. I'd love to contribute to this project
Did you set the server up yourself on a machine you own?
No it's hosted elsewhere by enjin
I just have admin access on to some panel they gave me
That's great :D Feel free to make a pull request at any time ^^
Okay, so you probably don't have access to the actual serveradmin password then
no, probably not
That's a special Server Query account with unlimited permissions, basically
I noticed they've an account logged with more power than mine
Okay, so: \n1) connect to your server\n\n2) Toolbar > Tools > \ServerQuery Login\\n\n3) Enter a username, preferably yours, and write that down somewhere \n\n4) Press okay and the TS server will generate a password for you
This is your username - password combination which you can use for your server query
ah I see
Did that work?
Yea
Okay, now you should preferably use TS3Config.setLoginCredentials(username, password)
Then the query will do the logging in for you automatically when you connect
And now, basically, things should work as expected ^^
http://pastebin.com/ruyD765E
Nope, sadly not :P
I can give you my code if you like, anything sensitive is behind an enum
Sure, that would be great
http://pastebin.com/GzqvgWyF
Here you are 
Thank you. Is my assumption correct that your password `botConfig.setLoginCredentials(DataStrings.BOT_NAME, \\);` is not just an empty string?
Ah whoops, fixed that 
I assumed that was the server password
It appears to connect without error now
Basically if you don't give it a password, what is sent to the server is `login username `
which is a syntax error
Explaining the error message you were getting
instead of `login username password`, so it's missing a parameter is what I wanted to say ^^
Hah! It works, excellent, thank you so much
That was just funky to get setup I think
Yeah, basically the API requires a certain knowledge of how TS3 server queries work
I see now :P
Maybe we should expand our tutorials and / or create some wiki pages for all that stuff ^^
Probably, the one that was there made me believe that I'd get away with just calling #connect after setting up
and it'd connect like a client
Is there a way to make the bot visible as a client that can be messaged?
Something else I can wholeheartedly recommend is this addon for the TS3 client:\nhttp://addons.teamspeak.com/directory/skins/stylesheets/Extended-Client-Info.html
It shows you the IDs of clients and channels and all that stuff in your client
Which TS3 included before but which was all thrown out a few updates ago. They didn't want to confuse the \normal users\ with all the ID stuff
Yes and no - you cannot make it so all clients see server queries
But you can toggle it on for yourself
I mean so that I can see the bot in the lobby and such
Just though it'd be nice to be able to see it or whatever
Go into your favorites -> Edit Favorites (or something like that) and select the entry of your server
Manage Favorites probably
Then at the bottom left there's a button saying \More\ with an arrow on it
Make it so that menu is extended
You mean bookmarks?
Yeah
Translations are fuzzy, sorry ^^
show query clients
Exactly
Nah no worries your English is exceptional for a non native speaker
I didn't bother switching the UI back to English, sorry ^^
Why thank you :D
Hm even after that I don't see it
You'll probably have to log out and back in, probably
With both the server query and your regular TS3 query
*regular TS3 client
Sick! Now I can move onto writing listeners and such
By default, your server query won't even receive private messages, if you intend to send your commands that way
So you'll have to register that event with TS3Api.registerEvent(TS3EventType.TEXT_PRIVATE)
Does the registerallevents method not handle that?
And after that you can register an event listener with TS3Api.addTS3Listeners
That works, too
By the way, are you using the latest official release, 1.0.11?
Yea, I am
There's a bunch of new features, improvements and bugfixes in the snapshot releases
Which is a concept you should be familiar with, seeing how you have the SpongeAPI forked on your GitHub account :D
I used to administer a server, too, in the pre-DMCA days
Really?
I use spigot now
And I check up on sponge every so often
Yup ^^\nAnd I wrote a plugin that basically connected the chats of both the Minecraft and the TS3 server
called BukkitSpeak, I think that was the only TS3-Minecraft-plugin around in the Bukkit days ^^
Hah that's part of what I was going to do
I just changed my user idk if took affect here
Yeah, I'm watching the progress on Sponge, too. But I've lost quite a bit of motivation when it comes to Minecraft. I basically don't play it anymore :/
Assuming you changed it to something different than \closedAccount\ then no
I changed it to TheVonLeon :P
But I'm already getting the lovely old 404 on the GitHub link, though
I gotta move away from this username, too. Chose it when I was 10 or something like that.
It's okay for games and stuff but kinda embarrassing when it comes to coding
I think it's okay
Oh god that formatting O.o
By the way, feel free to look through the source of [BukkitSpeak](https://github.com/Firedroide/BukkitSpeak/tree/BukkitSpeakMerged/) if you're interested. It is built on an older, different TeamSpeak API, though.
And it is built on a few, ehrm, questionable design decisions
haha I don't think I'll mind
I've only been a developer about 2-3 years now
I actually continued the plugin after it had been abandoned by the original creator, and some things were just never changed
so any decisions I make are likely questionable as well
If you ever need a helping hand for your Sponge plugin or have any questions - feel free to ask me at any time.
Was Java your first programming language?
Yea
Second favourite as well
Kay :D\nI started with Visual Basic. It's nice if you want to just quickly throw stuff together and get a quick-and-dirty UI out as soon as possible. The language, however, is ... not that attractive.
Which one is your favorite, then?
I hate vba
Haskell
I love Haskell
I've never tried it, but I guess that's another language to check out, then ^^
It's a functional programming language
so it's hard to get used to but it's really good
Super fast + super clean
The only thing I've heard about it so far is that's it's rarely ever used in real-world applications and remains mostly in an academic setting.
VB is not quite the same as VBA, by the way. VB is a \dirty-looking\ language, but other than not even all that bad. But VBA, that's just bad combined with worse.
You use irc at all?
Not really. I have a client and all installed, but I don't really frequent any servers and channels.
Oh, okay. Normally people who devved on bukkit/spigot use irc
I'm always on at #java on esper
I just didn't grow up with the whole IRC thing; I think the first time I've heard of it was a few years ago
What age are you?
Same as me
I didn't grow up with it either, I just use it a lot anyway
Good for dev chat
I think that's debatable. I feel like there's a lot of noise on these channels, where basically no real information is transmitted
There is that
But I'm opped on #java so people shut up when I want to talk code :D
\\#haskell on freenode is pretty much non stop code talk too
That was unexpected
You can edit messages, btw
Speaking of noise, want to move to private chat? I think we're getting a bit off-topic when it comes to this TS-API
whatever floats your goat
Turns out I can't, probably due to your name change
I can though
Usually there's a button called \chat privately\ doesn't show up for me
http://pastebin.com/ZhW6JJ71 Anyone know what the cause of this might be?
Figured it out, used old SNAPSHOT version. Bug was already fixed
Hi guys! Can someone explain the TS3Listener methods onClientMoved, onClientLeave and onClientJoin? Or point me to some TS3 API documentation because I don't understand when these fire. :(
Okay so onClientLeave is leaving the server, whereas moved refers to both joining and leaving regardless of reason? Anyways, my real question is, I want to do something when a client leaves on his own, but not when he is moved out by an admin? How can I accomplish this?
Got a quick question. Is there any way to make the Bot reconnect on its own after the TS went down? After my daily TS reboot, it simply always tries to use whoami without getting any answer.
@isaackaufman \n\n- onClientJoin is fired when a client joins the server\n- onClientLeave is fired when a client leaves the server or is kicked / banned\n- onClientMoved is fired when a client moves to a different channel or is moved by someone else. Use getClientTargetId() to get the new channel ID (to determine if the client moved in or out, for example)\n\nFor all these events, the same rules apply. If someone else moved / kicked / banned the client, the event will always include these 3 fields:\n\n- getInvokerId() - the client ID of the client who caused the event to happen\n- getInvokerName() - this client's \clientname\\n- getInvokerUniqueId() - this client's UID\n\nOtherwise - if the client caused the event to happen by themselves - these fields will be -1 or an empty string, depending of the type.
@1n9i9c7om I've replied on #1 . TL;DR: Not yet implemented & should be implemented in the future. The best you can do until then is, in my opinion, creating a watchdog thread that creates a new query.
Sorry for the long delays at the moment. My internet connection is currently anything but stable ^^
Does this have a maven repo?
yea it does nvm
Does anyone know if teamspeak client uids are UUID as in globally unique, only one can exist per user or no
Additionally, anyone know what the boolean for the ts3asyncapi#getclientbynamexact(String, boolean) is?
dammit nvm my ide bugged out, it's for ignore case lol
@TheVonLeon UIDs are unique in the way that if a client disconnects from your TS3 server and reconnects in X years, that UID will stay the same. There is one caveat, however: Users can generate a new identity (which holds their UID) at any time and use any identity they've generated.\n\nSo, the answer is no, there doesn't necessarily have to be just one UID per user.
I wish there was a better way to keep track of a user, although I'm not sure if I would agree with having go register with teamspeak and grab an id from their server
@isaackaufman you couldn't stop a user from getting a new UID anyways, provided TeamSpeak stays free. IPs and MACs can be changed and new e-mail addresses can be created for free, too. In fact,  I kinda like the system they have going on. A client having the same UID guarantees that they're actually the same client. Sure, UIDs are not that efficient for banning clients, but that's not what UIDs were made for in the first place.
Yeah that's true. So uid changes by client then, not identity? Those aren't analogous from my knowledge
What I'm wondering is if it is secure or not. If they are just genned, couldn't someone just gen the same UID as someone else?
Seem to be having an issue whereby one TextMessageEvent is causing an infinite loop of TextMessageEvents, relevant listener code: http://pastebin.com/JpxsTt8h
You need to add a condition that the sender of the message is not the not so it doesn't trigger off its own message
Is that new? I had one running just like this a while ago and it didn't cause this
I don't think so, if you look at the commit I made a while back, it fixes the same issue in an example bot. So I guess it depends how far back you are going
ah I see it now. Makes sense
I'll look into the source code tomorrow, the logic migt be able to be applied elsewhere
Internet hangup, old message wasn't sent.\n\nEach identity has one UID, which cannot change. You could say the UID defines your identity. A client can generate multiple identities and could even delete old identites. You can press Ctrl + I to directly open the identities window.\n\nAs for security, it's pretty damn secure. The UID is sufficienty long that the chance for someone else to generate the exact same UID is unimaginably low - if it's actually randomly generated.
So
If I'm doing something on a uid basis, the user can just make a new identity to get around it
yea
You can have multiple UIDs at once since you can just swap profiles basically whenever
And yes, you sending a text message will of course fire a TextMessageEvent. If you only want to respond to humans, check if client_type is 0
it's probably Client.getClientType()
Firedroide, would you suggest hardcoding this check into ontextmessagesent()?
Nope, it's [Client.getType()](https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/theholywaffle/teamspeak3/api/wrapper/Client.java#L110).
Uhm, as in into the API?
Yes sorry
yea I don't see any instance where me responding to my own event is useful
more an overhead thing
Being able to re-enable it by using like api.setFireTextEvents(true); or something would be nice provided the default is false
Well, maybe not that but you might be able to respond to other query clients, idk ^^\nBut really, I don't think that we should do that.
Just because I don't want to artifically limit the query interface or \hide\ these features.
less responding based on type
more responding based on id
No I was talking about a check to see if the message was sent by the siecific server query client
Aka the not responding to itself
You can ignore an event if it's a query client OR if it has the same sender id
Yea
Not*
Bot* fuck
one second, gotta check some sources
Hm, it appears that the client type is not actually sent, but only the ID, database ID and the UID
then just make the default ignoring your own text messages, because it only serves to add overhead
responding to other clients, absolutely useful
I'll think about it and decide what to do later. But yes, you're right in that it only adds overhead
Nobody should ever need to receive events about messages they sent themselves
I wonder if we even need to add a config option for that at all.
Cause I really can't see why someone would need these events.
that's what I'm saying
Just like how I manually \patched out\ the events which were sent twice. It caused confusion and didn't help anyone
I dont think there is an argument against putting this in the api
Yeah, I'll probably change it. Expect a commit in the near future.
Can I ask you two something else?
Sure
I'm about to add a feature to reconnect the client if there's a timeout or something like that
like a watchdog  timer?
Now I wonder what I should do to commands which were sent but which we didn't actually get a sever response back
Kinda, but not quite
If there is a disconnect, the SocketReader will throw a IOException
I'd register the ID of the Users who sent commands, then allow people to handle a reconnect event accordingly
so we can send a message saying it crashed or something
I like having an ioexception thrown
I don't think that's exactly pertinent von
Nah, the exception is caught in the listener. No IOExceptions will leak into user code, and that's how it should be.
All we should worry about is getting reconnected without needing to restart the not
Oh you are talking about something timing out persay as opposed to an actual disconnect?
I'm talking about the query getting disconnected from the server for some reason that is not the user calling query.exit(). Like the server timing out or someone unplugging a cable
*Like the server crashing or being shut down is what I wanted to say
Can we do something like calling api.connect() repeatedly or whatever the method is
I don't see how my suggestion is not relevant then, I  would like to *know* when I reconnect and have a list of people that never received  a response from the bot so that I can tell them about it, at least that seems like a reasonable use case to me for a disconnect. 
@isaackaufman preferrably I'd like the query to handle this directly, without having the users include boilerplate code for every project
Well what if the bot isn't communicating with the users
Then the list I mentioned would be empty and you'd have nothing to do
@TheVonLeon I never said your suggestion is irrelevant ^^
That's not what I meant, when a listener captures an ioexecpion it should start calling api.connect(), would that work?
And that makes more sense now von, thanks
It does seem like a useful feature
Kinda, that's the internals of the reconnect system, but that's not actually what I need input on
It's more an issue of how we should tell the developers / users about this
As in that there was a disconnect?
Yes
Hmm, let's get you up-to-date on the internals of the query first
As I say, firing a specific reconnect event would be really nice
That way you can bundle why it was disconnected so that we may possible log it, a list of people it was communicating so we can tell them
So, there's two threads, a SocketReader and a SocketWriter and a list of commands
and do our own listener there too
Now, the SocketReader will look at the first command in this list and will send it to the server if the command has not yet been sent
*SocketWriter
The SocketReader on the other hand will take the response from the server, handle the response and remove the command from the list
That's cool
Now, in case of a disconnect, the SocketWriter will still send out the command, and this will not throw an exception or anything of that sort
The only thing that will happen is the SocketReader not receiving a response and eventually throwing an exception after maybe half a second
Do you two have an idea how I could determine whether that last command that has been sent has actually made its way to the server?
There isn't if the query is unable to receive a response, there's no way to determine what happened to the command 
Hm, that is a dilema 
dilemma*
Maybe
Well, if it is only one command I don't see there being too much of an issue
The server could log the result of commands and   send them to the query on reconnect
Just tell us which was last sent and whatnot
or rather which *may* have been sent
Could that be achieve with a query connected on the same host as the server?
That's kind of a convoluted system though
It just wasn't designed for this kind of task and I'm trying to find the cleanest and most powerful solution
Then my suggestion would be, as von said to just resend the last command which didn't receive a response
That's probably the best solution, but it doesn't really account for all possible use-cases
Say the last command created a new channel and it made it to the server before getting disconnected
Now if we just re-send that command, there will be two new channels on the server
Worst possible case would be the command that generates a new query login for the currently connected client
I mean we could just do nothing, throw a TS3ConnectionFailedException and let the user take it from there
Yes I like that
I would like to control what happens
For different situations
Problem is you can't ^^\nYou don't have access to the list of queued up commands, e.g. from the asynchronous api. Nor can you really \reconnect\ a TS3Query, you'd need to create a whole new query
Then maybe we need a method to do that
Even if I were to make everything public, it wouldn't help you. You still couldn't tell if the last command was actually processed by the server
Or clone the api and connect
And let's be honest, nobody would create a \disconnect handler\ for every single command
Right but I could determine whether I want it resent or not
I guess
Idk its a rock and a hard place
Actually, it doesn't really matter, we'll have to just re-send the command
Cause what matters to us, what allows us to continue is the server response saying that there was no error
Yeah that's the best and simplest solution for this particular api I guess
And even if the server received the last command, without the response we could never be sure if the command actually worked
It's still messy as hell ^^
Yeah but short of rebuilding the whole api there's nothing you can really do
And I think I should also add an option to disable the command timeout for synchronous commands altogether
So then what happens if you lose connection?
The query reconnects, sends the command (again), gets the server response and returns it to the user
Oh got it
That works
And if the reconnection never succeeds, the method will never return
*insert evil laughter or something*
Basically just an option that says \don't continue unless the command was actually handled\
Well the other option would just result in exiting the query connection
sorry had dinner
Yea I agree, I don't really mind the command thing I'd just like a list of people that the bot was interacting with and an event regarding it
Isn't that extremely specific? Like it only really applies to chat commands
Shouldn't be too hard to implement though, I may make a pr at a later date for it though if it's too much trouble
Sure, go ahead :)\nI think I just don't get the whole picture of what information you'd actually like
An Event that fires when it reconnects with a list of people it was meant to be talking to via chat commands
So that I can possibly append/prepend messsages
or tell an administrator \Hey I disconnected, something might be wrong with your internet\ or something
if the vps/whatever im hosting my bot on happens to go down at the time, since i've a crontab set to run this on startup
Sure, I get the whole event idea, but what do you mean by \list of people the bot is talking to\
Like, the query doesn't acutally collect that information
Nor does it have a concept of a conversation
You do pass an ID for which to send messages to/whatever
Yes. So, assuming you're using the synchronous API, this is what happens:\nThe query takes your command and puts it into the list, sends it, gets the response and removes it from the list. Then it returns to your code and takes the next command
In case of the synchronous API, there is never more than one command in the list, iirc
So only one client / channel / server ID from a chat command in that list
I think we're not really on the same wavelength, I hope you're not facepalming right now
Sorry if you are.
No no, just was not aware that it never had more than one command in the list for the sync api
In which case just firing the event itself would be nice, for logging's sake and such.
By the way, I just reverse-engineered how query passwords are stored in the database and wrote a small tool that lets you change anyone's query password to whatever you want.
It was pretty damn simple, too :/
Awesome! What is the application as a server admin?
There is none
Well still cool. How are they stored?
Take password, convert to UTF-8 bytes, hash em (no salt), convert the whole thing to base 64 and store it in the database.
How did you figure that out? Like what was the process
Read the \encrypted\ passwords out of the database, looked a lot like b64. Used Java b64 decoder, got back random bytes. That already meant that my assumption of it being b64 was correct.\n\nNext I used a known-password exploit. I knew the password of my serveradmin query login and knew the bytes I got back from b64 decoding the stored password. Then I basically just tried a few different hash algorithms until I found the one they were using and it got me the exact same bytes that I had got from the b64 decoding.
What hash algorithm was it?
To confirm that that worked I set the serveradmin password to \password\ and logged into the TS3 server using telnet, and lo and behold it worked.
could have just rainbow tabled since it has no salt
True, the format of TS3 query passwords is well known so you could even just brute-force it. Take oclHashcat, let your GPU heat your room for a few minutes and get back all passwords in plaintext.
\Cracking\ the passwords was just not what I was going for. I wanted the option to change query passwords so we could potentially do integration testing without having to hardcode or otherwise pass in some password (which could also change).
is there an enum for ClientType?
Does it not tell you in the documentation?
Cannot see anything about it
figured out through my own testing that standard clients are of type 0
Yup
I should maybe create an enum for this ^^
0: client, 1: query
and no idea if there's anything else, unfortunately isn't documented
sounds like it should be a boolean instead
or something
like isQueryClient()
checks said value and returns what true if it is 1
I like that
Can just make the clienttype into private 
Also something that has been *really* bothering me is the notation that you need to call the api to send a client a message. It feels like having that built on to the Client class as well as the event class would make for much cleaner code
so instead of me having to build a client object just to send a message, I can just type event.getClient().sendPrivateMessage(\something\);
See, that's the sort of thing I really want to avoid. The problem with this is that it hides the actual API calls underneath
Meaning that the user is even less likely to do the needed error checking
Not really, if you document that it does that it doesn't really matter
Implying people read the 
There really isn't that much documentation to read, sadly :/
*documentation on every simple getX method they call
There is on the actual API methods
I documented every single one, more or less
in TS3Api and TS3ApiAsync
The other problem I haven't even mentioned yet
Is the huge risk of memory leaks
In what way?
If you let every object that is created by the API have a reference to TS3Api, you won't be able to GC the TS3Api until every single object with a reference to it has been GC'd before
Why would you want to gx the api?
gc
Now, for TS3Api alone this isn't that bad since it doesn't hold much in terms of data, but TS3Api has a reference to the TS3Query, which again holds SocketReader and SocketWriter, which hold all the data needed for the connection
but why is that a problem, in any of my implementations I only ever cause an api gc when i terminate 
Well, that's true.
I imagine as you get high on the number of instances of ts3query you start to use a lot of memory right?
No, that's not the problem
The TS3Api and everything else mentioned before only exists once
and as they're object, they're stored in the heap
*objects
So every object holding a reference to the API object has only a slightly increased memory cost
It's not zero, but it's not significant either
I kinda talked around that one, what I wanted to say was: An object wouldn't store a whole new TS3Api in itself, but rather a reference to the API, which takes up much less memory
Basically, you could compare the current implementation of the TS3 API to OpenGL
It's a low-level library basically, which just mirrors the commands which would be sent behinds the scenes in another language - or in this case with a different protocol
Which is nice because you can see what actually happens and you can tweak the performance of your application very easily
When you start to add a high-level API like the event.getClient() you suggested, you start to lose that clarity
Let's say we were to get a list of clients and we would then want to get all of their channels
The low-level approach to this is\n1. Get list of all clients\n2. Get list of all channels\n3. Map clients to channels\n4. Print it or whatever
That's 2 API calls and takes about 4 * <one-way ping to the server> + a few milliseconds
What I'm afraid of is people doing this:
1. Get a list of all Clients\n2. For each client, call client.getChannel()\n3. Print it or whatever
And now you've complicated a problem that would've taken 2 API calls to a problem that takes 1 + n API calls
Increasing the time needed to get the result you're after from maybe a hundred milliseconds to maybe a second
That's where I see the real problem, it obfuscates the actual data transfer that's happening and the time needed for all of this.
You can easily end up with linear or even quadratic complexity without even thinking about it. Whereas pretty much all methods (would have to double-check) in TS3Api and TS3ApiAsync require a constant amount of API calls, usually just 1
As I say, wouldn't really matter if it was properly documented as such telling people that there are better ways to do it
IMO it's just facilitating bad performing code. In 99% of all cases you already have a reference to the API already anyways. Sure, `event.getClient()` looks nice, but is `api.getClientById(event.getClientId())` really that much worse?
I'm a fanatic for cleaner code.
But maybe I'm really just too conservative and too protective of the API here.
I'm pretty sure \protective\ is not a word or at least not the word that would've been correct.
Maybe if we'd move away from the whole \getX\ structure it would be more obvious as to what's going on
Like maybe rephrase that method to `event.requestClient()` or something like that
So it's clear for everyone that this method doesn't just return an object that wasn't already stored
Or \retrieve\ maybe? What's your opinion on the wording?
requestClient sounds nice
Maybe I should also add more documentation on how many API calls any method actually produces.
I just need to acutally work on the API a bit more, I've been lazy a lot lately xD
I don't know, once I figured out the distinction between client ID and the Client object and how to grab one from the other, it was easy to make sense of how to navigate around the API.
I guess what I'm saying is I don't have an issue with the clarity in general
[2015-07-28 21:47:28.102] [SEVERE] TS3 command error: {id=1540, msg=convert error} Is there any guide for reading the error output? I'd much prefer if there was a toggle for a stacktrace or something
I realise that it's a generic query error but more information as to what the actual cause is would be nice
Does the API only allow for one listener to each event?
Hm nope...it does allow more
oh I see what I'm doing wrong. What exactly is the difference between event.getInvokerId() and event.getClientId() ? 
I was using invokerid and it was spewing errors
ClientId is the ID of the client who was affected by this event, e.g. the client who changed channels / was moved, etc.
InvokerId is the ID of the client who caused that event to happen, but it doesn't necessarily have to exist. If the client causes the event to happen by himself (e.g by changing channels instead of being moved / kicked), there won't be an InvokerID and you'll get back -1 as a value
And again, this is just an API and not a whole re-definition of the TS3 query protocol. The errors you get back here are the same you'd get if you used telnet to send a command, for example. Moreover, we even include a log of everything you've sent or received to facilitate bug-hunting and troubleshooting.
But categorizing and offering more in-depth information about the well over 100 error codes (none of which are in the TS3 query documentation, btw, that's just from experimentation) is not something we can easily do. We'd need actual information from the TS3 devs, and even then, error codes and messages can always change
Am i really using a chat for a github repisitory ? :D
You sure are :)
You can ask any kinds of questions here. I'm usually around, @TheHolyWaffle not that often but he shows up, too
Same goes for feature requests / bug reports! All welcome here ^^
Do you think its possible to implement this into a minecraft client?
Depends on what exactly you want to do. If you just want to transmit your client chat to a TS3 server, probably.\nIf you want to integrate a *full* TS3 client into Minecraft, including voice and everything else, I suggest you just open that process in the background instead of trying to integrate it.
Yes of course im only talking about chat and simple ingame commands like \.teamspeak ban <partOfClientName>\
That would of course be possible. I've done something just like that, just server-based via a Bukkit plugin
I was just asking cause server/clientside are somehow very different ^^
Not in terms of interaction with a TS3 server. They're both \clients\ using a server query that connects to the TS server. As long as you can get hold of a chat event or hook into a method that is fired when the player sends a message, you should be fine.
But i was thinking more about a client query integration.
Cause as serverquery i can't see ppl's messages to me
Yes you can, take a look at the [servernotifyregister command](https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/theholywaffle/teamspeak3/TS3Api.java#L2738).
Yes but try to tell a regular client to msg your query xD He will ask u \WTF are u talking about?\ xD
Oh i see. This whole repository is about the server query ._.
I honestly have no idea how you would go about modding an entire utility program into a game
Client query is almost the same as server query
It just differs between some commands
There is already full skype integration for several minecraft clients.
incl. call status / video overlay
I haven't really heard of client queries before, I must admit
But seeing the commands and everything it seems pretty similar to server queries
http://forum.teamspeak.com/showthread.php/66509-Official-ClientQuery-Plugin
Maybe if you're lucky, this API will also work for clients, save for the few changed commands
I will give it a try.
Examples/Docs\nDocumentation and Examples are shipped with the TS3 Client, from your TS3 Client installation Folder go to \plugins/clientquery_plugin\ for per command documentation and \plugins/clientquery_plugin/examples\ for example code and a README.
I've seen that, have one of the files open right now
The one issue you will run into is the clientnotifyregister
Waffle can make a copy of this repo and make the few needed changes to have a clientquery api
*Maybe...
If you want to contribute, that would be great as well. I certainly don't have the needed amount of experience to integrate client queries right now.
Im experienced with server/clientquery but not with java :D
Ah, okay
http://redeemer.biz/medien/artikel/ts3-query/
http://redeemer.biz/medien/artikel/ts3-query-notify/
Its in german but you can try to translate it with GTranslator
Fortunately I speak German, as well
Is there any way to capture the voice data stream of a user and store it?
Nope, no interaction with voice data is possible.
would probably be over my head anyways haha
this clientquery stuff is pretty cool actually
id love to see a java api implementation for it
i dont know actually the python stuff they have in the example directory is pretty cool already
Waffle, would you be interested in hosting your API on a proper maven repo ?
and a CI if you'd like
Waffle doesn't read this chat very often, so I guess I'll jump in :)\n\nI, for one, am very interested in getting a proper CI solution. Currently, we've configured Travis.CI to automatically create build artifacts and then upload them to a sort-of Frankenstein Maven repository on GitHub. Basically, we're using about every tool at our disposal for something that tool wasn't supposed to do ^^\n\nWe've considered different options, but the problem has always been that we're operating on 0 budget and that we'd prefer a somewhat established solution that doesn't just disappear again after a few weeks.\n\nSo, if that's something you could offer, we'd be very thankful and would love to hear more!
Have him email me: contact@sinndevelopment.com if he's interestedf
sorry for my absence
About the maven repo, even though it is a hacky approach. I still like it a lot for the sole reason that github has a great uptime and longevity in the future.
Yeah, but GitHub is not a file host, it's for code files which are tracked by Git. Hosting binary files is heavily discouraged in the GitHub TOS ^^\nMoreover we can't push this repo onto the Maven Central repository.
I was only able to make the metadata update correctly on GitHub after a lot of hacking with bash scripts.
And there is no automated method we could use to delete old snapshot builds, which are currently just building up indefinitely
His maven repository won't get the project on maven central repository either I believe.
You can only do that if you get your project on sonatype or if you're Apache
I mean this: http://search.maven.org/
Hmm, you're probably right
Although I thought that the Sonatype Nexus instance which is hosted by a friend of mine had an option to mirror it into Maven Central
than we might as well try to get the project on sonatype :P
instead of relying on someone else' server
I'm not saying we have to take Jamie Sinn's offer, but I would at least like to know what exactly it consists of :)
like he said, a maven repo + ci
I'm sorry, but I don't think it is worth the effort right now to change what we have.
Yeah, it probably isn't
Sonatype would still be an interesting option, though. We'd need to figure the whole PGP signing thing out first, though
It's quite the hassle
you'd have to push the pgp key files to the repo
but encrypted
than have them decrypted by travis and use them in the maven signing process
Travis has this system for passwords and the like
yes, that is where you store the key used to decrypt pgp file
Couldn't we paste the content of the secret PGP key into such a form and then just echo them into the file?
that might sound ok
not sure if travis allows such huge strings
Tried it on a repo of mine and it worked for 65kB of prime numbers
So I think it should work for the PGP key, as well
https://github.com/BluscreamFanBoy/TeamspeakClientQueryAPI
Someone here who can help me?\nI want to build a TS3 Bot who reconnects automatically after a server crash...\n\nBut i can't find a good solution for that
If you scroll up there was a good conversation about it, I can't remember what the consensus was though, bottom line is you might have to do something hacky as there is no native method in the api
Yeah, it's pretty much that. It's something that needs to be implemented in the API, but I haven't been able to figure out a clean and safe way to do it. So if you have any ideas on the topic, Pull Requests are always welcome
I'll have a look if i can find something
Can't make an Pull request atm but I have an idea.
how about a event that gets called every \KeepAlive\Cycle and pass the result of thewhoami to the listeners
they can then decise to operate based on that event and maybe logib again
(I should not write from my mobile phone xD)
okay never mind... the only usecase for that can also be done with the ts3 disconnect event
I think I'm going to do a release of v0.12 now.
Or is there any bug or nuisance anybody wants to have fixed for this next release? :)
Now you can download the plugin without downloading the API too! https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/teamspeak-verifier.8455/ . Hopefully the most bugs are fixed!
Wrong chat, @Mauricius17 :P\nI doubt there are a lot of your users here ^^
That is quite possible:)
I have a little question. Can I change this message if I add a client to a server group. (Its German sorry, I am a German man) http://prntscr.com/8d99jw
Glaub nicht, ist TS3 server intern
And now, let's go back to English. If anyone else wants to contact me in German, please use the private chat function.
I'd like to keep stuff in this channel in English so everyone present understands what's being talked about.
I'm a little new to teamspeak in general, and I wanted to make sure I knew how to do the credentials
rather, the config.setlogincredentials
basically, where do I set up a username for it to use?
I don't have a tutorial right here
But basically, you can either use `serveradmin`, which is a preconfigured server query with almost all permissions
and you should have received the password for that one when you set up your TS3 server
that's ringing a bell now
Or you can create a Server Query login of your own
If you are a served admin on your ts server, you can just create a new login with admin permission
Server*
sweet. thank you guys!
wait, that's not all ^^
really looking forward to working with this API, looks well built
If you create a login in your client
By going to `Settings > Server Query Login`
It will only receive the permissions your client has
just looked up a tutorial for it
its just RIGTH THERE  (facepalm)
And you can only create 1 server query login per TS3 client
So if you create a new one it'll delete the old one
you say per TS3 client
does that mean per server, or per machine with a client?
One client can have one Server Query client bound to them on each TS3 server they visit
And one one TS3 server, each client can have one query login
ok, that's what it sounded like, but I wanted to make sure
think that's all I need. Thank you for your time!
You're welcome! If there are any other questions, suggestions or bug reports, feel free to contact us here again or over on the GitHub issues page
I have a question...
Is it possible to get the password from a user with your api. I will creat a Minecraftlogin
What password are you speaking of? TS users don't have to authenticate themselves
If you join in any Server you see a field called password
Uhm, not as far as I'm aware of? Or are you speaking of a global server password?
check the Username and password in my database of they are right the user will not be Kicked
Yes, the Globalpassword field 
Well, but that password is the same for all clients. Or are you using TS2 perhaps? TeamSpeak 2 had username / password authentication. Or perhaps you're using some kind of server plugin?
Lol the replys are  not in the right position 
No I will only catch the password from each Client and check them from my userdatabase.
(TS3)
I'm sorry, I'm really tired right now and I really have no idea what kind of password field you mean and how the whole system you're describing is working. Mind to send me some screenshots?
https://www.dropbox.com/s/vf6qstks3mqzm9z/image.png?dl=0
Yeah, but that's a server password, it's global and has to be correct. Because it's a password and because it's only transmitted when you're trying to connect to a server, there's no way for you to get at it.
I mean, that would be a huge security vulnerability
By each joined user the Server get the passwordfield and the Username
Except the server doesn't record that
Ok
If the server is not password protected, it throws the password you entered away
And if there IS a server password, you have to enter the correct one anyways
Thanks but can I change the serverpassword to the userpassword Byte each joined user 
No, you can't. That password is global.
Ok Thanks, but your API is very good :)
By the way, I really don't understand why exactly you want to do it this way
Like, if you want to restrict the TS3 server to the guys playing on your Minecraft server, you could just periodically write the TS3 IP and password into the chat, or let a plugin do that
This way is userfriendly
Something else you could do
is compare the IP of the newly joined TS3 user with all Minecraft clients
Yeah, this is plan B
Maybe even keep a log of stored IPs
*or a database
As I said, I'm tired as hell, sorry for the bad language
Thanks for your help ;)
Cya! If there are any other questions, feel free to ask them here again. If you have suggestions for the API or have encountered a bug, I'd suggest you use the GitHub issues page.
Hey Firedroide, want to check out a script I made using the API? I meant to show it to you guys a while ago but I forgot: https://github.com/isaackaufman/Teamspeak-Stuff
Its pretty funny in practice, curiosity causes people to get trapped in the channel :D
Cool stuff :D
But dude, I really need to go to sleep now, it's 3am here
I'll take a closer look at it tomorrow or on Friday, I promise
Oh lol, it's all good!
Don't worry I just wanted to share :)
I have a question: Why is it so difficult to reconnect? Isn't it such easy as you do the following: Is Socket closed or not connected  - > restart
Or is the restart difficult? 
Because of a few things, actually. First up, Socket's isConnected method doesn't actually tell you when a disconnect happens. Instead, reading from the InputStream will throw an IOException; whereas writing to the OutputStream will simply block indefinitely without doing anything. Next up, we need to resend that last command that (probably) wasn't actually sent. To do this, we need to reset that command's runtime values and re-insert it into the outgoing queue. Neither the queue nor the command were built to support this operation. Then, we need to deal with all the reference and IO-Stuff like making sure nothing references the old Streams anymore and make sure that these are closed properly and the threads are shut down. After that, we could say \ok, connection re-established, done\ but it's not that easy. You're now reconnected, but not logged in and not in the correct channel. So how do we make sure the users of this API can act on a reconnect while still continuing the previous operations? I'm currently leaning towards an event-driven system: Just let the user write a method that makes sure the query is in a usable state again so we can resume sending the old commands after calling that listener. But finally, maybe the biggest problem of them all: I just don't have the time to write a clean, presentable solution to the problem, as I'm studying Computer Science. I even got a whacky, buggy solution running locally, but it's just not up to the standards of this API yet.
Sorry for the wall of text, I am currently on mobile but still wanted to answer your question properly.
Hey, I have a question: Am I able to make the bot visible so users can see in which channel he currently is?
You as a server operator or the bot itself can't. The users, however, can make their client show query users.
I believe the client has to have \show query clients\ enabled in their settings. Someone correct me
Damn you're quick lol
Wow such fastness xD
Where is the option for showing the query users?
Bookmarks > Manage Bookmarks > choose your server from the list > More (bottom left corner) > Tick \Show ServerQuery Clients\
It's not a great solution, I know, but it's the only one there is currently ^^
As far as I know you can add it to your toolbar Rightclick -> edit toolbar and search for something with query
You're welcome! If you have any other questions please feel free to ask us here again! As you can see, we love to help :smile:
Well, another question: Is it able to make the query watch all channels at the same time?
One Question. Is TheHolyWaffle working on this project or are you the only one,  Foredroide? 
You can try to switch between all channels xD
I tried, but the bot is too slow :D
@Smoothie2 Well.... yes and no. You can make a ServerQuery register to all Channel events. That is, clients joining and leaving the channel
@Smoothie2 You can, however, not monitor chat for all channels
Okay..
So I made that the bot sends periodically message to the users, because they should be able to write to the bot although they closed the conversation
*messages 
It's a limitation of the ServerQuery interface itself, there's not much we can do about that. The TS3 devs stated on their forum that this is intended behaviour, too.
@Scrumplex Just as an input: You could make the bot watch server broadcasts or just messages in a specific channel where clients could type a \command\ like !bot and the bot would respond to that
@Firedroide I am not the biggest pro in TS3 Server Query but is it possible to see if chat partner closes the conversation 
Because I don't think messaging users periodically is very user-friendly
@Firedroide Yes but it isnt user friendly of everycan should write into the server chat
@Scrumplex Nope, sorry. The only thing you could register is when a client leaves the server and therefore \closes\ the window.
Man what happened to ny keyboard 
That's also the only thing the TS3 Client sees when you chat with someone
I don't like the Server Query API so much
It feels like it is not finished
It certainly has it flaws. But imo it does its job.
Best example: Client Leave notify doesn't have much information 
Like uid or database id
The TS3 devs don't really care about it either, which is pretty sad. I wish the interface were more cleaned up and actually feature-complete.
But whatever, gotta do with whatever they give us; it's better than nothing ^^
Yep
Oh another question... Why is the command whoami null sometimes? 
(the response) 
Disconnected from the server
That's the most likely response I can give you
To answer your other question: Technically @TheHolyWaffle administers this repository and I'm just a contributor. I haven't heard from Waffle in a long time, though, so it's basically just me responsible for keeping the code working and answering support requests at the moment.
And I basically try to maintain the API and \keep it on course\ without drifting away too far from Waffle's design ideas.
I added my KeepAlive thread to my bot (Checks every 15 secs if whoami is null). It shuts down if whoami is null. But I made a shutdown hook to java, which sends a last message to the server. And that message will be sent. And then the bot stops (restarts cause of bash script) 
Okay 
That's... simple but effective I guess? :D
Yes but I don't understand why whoami is null although he could send his last nessage
It's due to weirdness in Socket's Input- and OutputStream
Hehe I (don't) like java sockets
InputStream will block until a message arrives, OutputStream will still allow one message to be \sent\ before blocking the next time
And again, I'm not 100% sure on this one but it's the best answer I can give you without digging through code right now.
By the way, v0.13 should contain a better reconnect solution.
Oh do you need any credit or something in my Teamspeak 3 Bot? 
Because I need to keep in mind that my bot won't exist without this api
From the license file: Permission is hereby granted to [...] under the following\n conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\n included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
But that's basically just the legal stuff and honestly, who cares ^^
xD Ok I will put a Powered by message into Console and the License File in the zip
\Powered by message\ is probably too strong, it's still your code. You could probably just put \This program uses the TeamSpeak-3-Java-API from https://github.com/TheHolyWaffle/TeamSpeak-3-Java-API\ or something like that
And as far as the license file is concerned, I'm not even sure whether you really should have to worry about that. We should probably include the license file in our distributed jar files directly.
So basically I think I need to modify the build process
okay.. Do you have any ideas why my ScheduledExecutorService is not working xD
Code or didn't happen :P
I think nothing happens because it doesn't even give me a log message that a broadcast message was sent
And i tested it with 1 seconds interval 
How do you instantiate your Executor? How do you schedule a command? I really need to see your code to be able to give you any more input
I am on my telephone so I need to try to improvise xD 
or do you have it pushed to github?
scheduler.runTaslAtFixedRate
No but I have the same code in my KeepAlive Executor
https://github.com/Scrumplex/Sprummlbot/blob/master/src/ga/scrumplex/ml/sprum/sprummlbot/Register.java
At the bottom the last void
I use the same code except, that I dont use 15secs
Are you using the Asnyc or the sync API in your command?
Cause it could be that each execution just takes much longer than 1 second
Sync one
I also tried it with 10 or something else
Well, just keep in mind that the sync really waits until the command is done
And that can take quite some time
and thus basically \stall\ out your executor
I know but sending a message to console doesn't take so long xD
If it's just one, sure. But if you're sending something to every client on a server with 200ms ping...
So syout should be nearly instant 
but even then, you're right, it should work at least sometimes ^^
so I don't know, really, I'd have to see your actual code ^^
It could actually be something like OutOfMemory because I would have 4 running executorservices
Uhm, probably not.
But I wonder, why would you need 4 separate services?
Because every service has seperate tick
If you use asynchronous programming paradigms, one of these should probably suffice
like, you can just schedule each at different intervals on the same executor
Oh didn't know that it is possible xD
But wouldn't they all be in the same thread so Thread.sleep will sleep all runnables? 
No, that's exactly why you use an executor. It does stuff the smart way and doesn't just Thread.sleep() :D
Okay. I just only ise it to determine if it is running or if it has been cancelled (by Exceptions or something) 
Exactly, that's one thing you have to watch out for. If your Runnable or Task or whatever throws an exception, it will stop executing and not be executed again the next time. So if you just want to keep everything running no matter what, you might have to just wrap the whole run method in a try-catch
I am going to sleep now. Bye
Kay, good night :)
Thank ya
By the way, you could still send me your code some other day
And I'll take a look at it and try to figure out what exactly isn't working
Am I able to disable the console output from the original plugin?
I can't quite follow. What do you mean by the original plugin?
Can I disable the debug messages?
pretty sure you can :D
Didn't you built in a disable method in the API?
One sec, gotta dig out the correct method name
On your original TS3Config object you pass to TS3Query, you can call setDebugLevel(Level.OFF)
This will disable *all* output from TS3 API
but you could also just choose Level.WARNING or SEVERE or whatever suits you
Ahh, thank you very much!
You're welcome :D

@constb You can currently swipe through the slideshow on touch devices... Or do you mean you want an effect like that? We are thinking of adding the `uk-width-xlarge-` classes. Maybe you post it in the [feedback list for UIkit 3](https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/560). BTW We have already `uk-grid-width-xlarge-` classes. Maybe they help you for now.
I made 2 persian website with UIKIT + Drupal last year :p \nand im trying to make my own web page with UIKIT and Laravel\ni like UIKIT :)  
but i cant work with pagekit as well as other CMSs
@saschadube well, right, it works on touch devices, but it only starts animation after the gesture is over. if you take a look at slickslider, flexslider, royalslider or \ideal image slider\ they all start animation when gesture starts and image follows the finger while you're moving it. then it animates to either the next slide or the previous one after you release. for a user it's not always clear that slider is actually touch-enabled if it doesn't work that way.
@constb ah, we will take a look at it
@saschadube thanks. I use uikit mostly to create admin interfaces for my projects - it has pretty much all components I need, so I just throw them in and everything just works. one thing I found to be missing though is a component to turn input[type=text] or textarea into tags editor like jquery-tags-input does. It's not that I somehow not allowed to use other plugins, it's just would be nice to have one out-of-the-box without adding dependencies. I added all this to uikit/uikit#560 too.
Hi, is there a way to connect lists, like http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists and http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#portlets ? I wanted to use your sortable, but it looked like i might need to use nestable plugin? Also, which layout option would be best to get something like http://layout.jquery-dev.com/demos/example.html , thanks!
@aheinze Any ideas on https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/808 yet? The stringify problem?
@malles try ```UIkit.Utils.options(element.attr('data-test'))```
No difference... Nor in 2.12. as in 2.15.0 http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yyJwPM
@malles http://jsfiddle.net/qo2q3uuv/ - it seems to fail with empty strings e.g. ```{ val: '' }```
Yes, it does. It also fails on semi-colons.
I don't think it should, though
no, this is a bug :-/
on colons that is 
I was afraid so 
I see what you did with the regex, and that works fine on most strings
I (mis)use the UI-components for other things as well, and pass some data through the options
you can use the old function:\n\n```javascript\n\nUIkit.Utils.options = function(string) {\n\n    if ($.isPlainObject(string)) return string;\n\n    var start = (string ? string.indexOf(\{\) : -1), options = {};\n\n    if (start != -1) {\n        try {\n            options = (new Function(\\ \var json = \ + string.substr(start) + \; return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(json));\))();\n        } catch (e) {}\n    }\n\n    return options;\n};\n```
I already use an old version of that function in my application now.
I'd like to use the default UIkit though
hey anybody in here ? i ahve a bit of an issue
i cant seem to get uikit installed well
using version 2.15.0 and uk.modal.hide and uk.modal.show events are not triggering - any suggestions? were working on version 2.11.1
Sorry to re-ask, would anyone mind to just give me a quick yes or no to my question a little earlier? thanks!!!
@OwenMelbz See https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/829
bower install uikit\nhas jquery dependency??? 
yes, uikit requires jquery
ou, \u041e\u041a
@OpalCreations sorry, no
Ok, thanks anyway!
Hi. You should put a blank index.html file inside the folder \administrator/components/com_widgetkit/\ in order to block the directory listing within a browser. 
And also - for RTL languages, the arrows on slideshow are flipped. I think that pagination arrows are flipped as well. 
Last thing - would be nice to have the widgetkit Item Link to be able to open in a new window. 
Hi. You should put a blank index.html file inside the folder \administrator/components/com_widgetkit/\ in order to block the directory listing within a browser. 
Hi @noam1982, the directory listing blocking should be done by your server, the index.html method is deprecated.
@noam1982 Thanks, for you suggestions. We put the RTL icons on our todo list.
I can't get UIKit working on Node.JS
I don't think it is supposed to...
It should if I use app.use(express.static(\/var/www/html/uikit/\));
I've even tested whether or not the files show up on the node server, and they do.
I am not a node user, know just a bit. But UIkit is for Dom manipulation in browser, that's not what node does?
Is it?
idk really
I'm trying to get the 'uk-navbar-brand' to work with a logo for small devices. It scales nicely on getuikit.com but it doesn't for me. The img skips out of the bar.\n```\n    <nav class=\fw-navbar uk-navbar\>\n        <-- normal menu -->\n        <a href=\#offcanvas\ class=\uk-navbar-toggle uk-visible-small\ data-uk-offcanvas></a>\n        <div class=\uk-navbar-brand uk-navbar-center uk-visible-small\>\n                <img src=\/img/logo_dark.svg\ width=\90\ height=\30\ title=\Vectoflow \alt=\Vectoflow\>\n        </div>\n    </nav>\n```
I am having a weird behavior: I created a header... It was full width, right after some content and the footer, but it was not full width. How can I fix it? 
I'm not sure what you mean. Maybe use `uk-width-1-1`
@malles I will get some screenshots, but basically the header is full, 100% of the width. The footer is just the \container\ width. I used no custom css. 
Probably don't put it in a `uk-container`. 
a simulation in codepen or jsfiddle would be helpful
@malles: oh, I did just put the container inside the nav bar and it worked gracefully.
@malles http://jsfiddle.net/u172kaur/1/
@malles how can I jump from one modal to another? 
take a look here: http://getuikit.com/tests/core/modal.html - \Trigger new modal inside current modal\
Nice going guys!\nLooking forward to the slideset :)
Great job guys. Really great job. 
@/all We released UIkit 2.16 with a new dynamic grid, lightbox and accordion :-)\n\nDynamic Grid http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_grid.html\nLightbox http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_lightbox.html\nAccordion http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_accordion.html\n\nDo you like it?
Nice additions, really usefull things.
Really nice to see the new additions added to UIKIT, thank you :).
Do you guys plan to add gutterless grids? and the accordion is missing its cursor on hover!
@alexdevine `data-uk-grid` has the gutter as an option. Would be nice to have that without JS though.
@alexdevine @malles Thanks guys! We are going to add a gutterless grid.
@alexdevine I have a cursor. Which browser do you use?
@saschadube Thank you and i really appreciate your time on this wonderful framework, I love using it :) 
@aheinze/@saschadube  Just wondering, @ https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/grid.js#L250 , why is the init not in the boot() function of the component?
@malles you're right - the boot function is to make sure that 2 or more loaded UIkit versions don't conflict -- the init code will be updated in the next release
one question
http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_lightbox.html
going to Different content sources
click youtube
opens modal
click play
click close modal
the lightbox was a bit buggy here
and sounds steal where
is it right way?
or video stream must stop too?
@proweb please open an issue on github
All form inputs in latest 2.16.0 have lost round borders
Checkboxes and radio buttons in form-advanced are uncorrectly rendered
anyone here?
@robertotremonti thank you for reporting, we'll look into that issue
ok, thanks, I've filed an issue on GH too
Seems a problem for all input elements, not radio and checkboxes only
ok, we'll check that
thank you
Side question: I can't set Lurk mode (notify of all messages) on this channel. I always get \notify of mentions\. Is that a admin setting?
I got this one :)
I've set it in other channels and regularly receive notifications for all messages, but on this channel they doesn't work
didn;t set anything at all, all default.. I do have a tab open with it..
If I close the app (or website) I don't receive any notification for this channel, other channels work. Don't know why
data-uk-grid-match seems broken in latest 2.16.1
it worked in 2.16.0
I confirm it's broken
I've got a question - can I add own buttons to HTML-editor?
Never used it, but I think it's this: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_customizer-json.html
mm... I told about HTML-editor addon
@robertotremonti can you be more detailed / could you provide a jsfiddle?
http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_htmleditor.html
@aheinze just updated my code and `data-uk-grid-match=\{target:'.rc-catalog-product-details'}\` worked in 2.16.0, while it doesn't work anymore in 2.16.1
I see changes in UIkit.Utils.matchHeights from changelog
could be this the problem?
I'll need to investigate it
@Ilya-Zhulin Ah I see what you mean. It seems possible, you'll have to investigate the code a bit: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/htmleditor.js#L171
but.. I don't want to touch core code.. I thought about some plugins or something else...
Oh.. I see.. AddButton function.. But where I can define functionality?
:) you don't need to touch it, just investigate and use it.\n
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/htmleditor.js#L136
hook on to this event, and do your actions
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/htmleditor.js#L232
Yeah.. I see :) 
And how it looks in example?
looks like `button` needs to be `{title:'',label:''}`
I'm afraid you are going to make that now :smile: 
Maybe @aheinze has a quick example, but he seems to be in a 'grid-lock' right now 
I understand you. But where I have to type a code? Atributes only defined here http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_htmleditor.html
get an instance of the editor:\n```\njQuery(function ($) {\n    var editor = UIkit.htmleditor($('#myEditor'));\n    editor.addButton.....\n});\n```
@Ilya-Zhulin try this:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).on('init.uk.component', '[data-uk-htmleditor]', function(e, name, editor) {\n\n    editor.addButton('mybtn',{\n        title  : 'My Button',\n        label  : '<i class=\uk-icon-magic\></i>'\n    });\n\n    editor.on('action.mybtn', function() {\n        alert(1);\n    });\n\n    editor.options.toolbar.push('mybtn');\n\n    editor.redraw();\n});\n```
yeah, or that :)
@aheinze , thank you, it works.
But, why, when I click to list button in HTML mode, editor wirtes `<li>` tags only? What about `<ul>`?
@aheinze data-uk-grid-match is not fixed in 2.16.2 yet
release notes says it is, but it doesn't work
do you want me to create a jsfiddle?
sorry, my fault
just found that now you need to add uk-grid-match class
not mentioned in release notes
@robertotremonti I see it in docs now, can't see any code referring to it.\nIf that class would be needed in all matched grids with target, I'd heva a big rewrite
Studied a bit.. the `.uk-match-height` is in UIkit since december, it's the CSS flex variant of match-height.
The JS `data-uk-grid-match` is for older browsers and targeting to a panel.
Your matching should work without `.uk-match-height` class, I think.
@robertotremonti please create a jsfiddle
@aheinze not needed, found how it works now
@malles it is in UIkit since Dec but found no mention of the change
@malles the grid is now flex based and only to support IE9 it has a float/clearfix fallback\nthe height of the direct children matches automatically (thanks to flex). But if you want to match the child > child (the uk-panel) you need to add the uk-match-height class\nfor IE9 you still need the data-uk-grid-match for both cases
uk-match-height works with flex only, is this right?
yep
but without the flex component, only on flex-supporting browsers
Missed that one...
yes
I will try to avoid the `data-uk-grid-match`as much as possible now, always disliked the JS overload for that
Flex FTW :)
I like the modal-header/footer btw
http://media1.giphy.com/media/EXzrnapKb8U92/200.gif
@malles also the ```uk-push-*``` and ```uk-pull-*``` classes are basically deprecated. Use the new ```uk-flex-order-*``` classes from the flex component
@malles @saschadube flex is \dynamic\ I don't like the resize/reordering effect when you resize the window
and automatic reorder doesn't work when you use pagination
it reorders only the panel you see in that page
I think you're cheating a bit on you're demopage :) \nYour `h2` header is nicely vertical centered in the header, since you have no margin on your headers by default on the docs-css
I have to use a `uk-margin-remove` on the header to get it fixed in the default themes
@malles they should rewrite documentation using uikit only without external resources ;)
@malles what do you mean? BTW I changed the ```uk-modal-header``` yesterday. Now the markup should be \n\n```<div class=\uk-modal-header\>\n    <h2>Headline</h2>\n </div>```\n\nThe margin from the last child (h2) should be removed automatically
margin bottom is, top isn't
I saw the change, that's why :)
But you don't have margin top in your theme
yes, but which default themes have it?
checking.. almost-flat has..

@saschadube I have a 80% wide content with a 20% wide right sidebar. in small devices I want to place the full width sidebar on top of the content. I can't in flex. any help?
@saschadube I'm wrong, it's the surrounding template messing things up :)
`<div class=\uk-flex\>\n\t<div class=\uk-width-1-1 uk-width-medium-4-5 uk-flex-order-first-medium uk-flex-order-last-small\>\n\t\tCATALOG\n\t</div>\n\t<div class=\uk-width-1-1 uk-width-medium-1-5 uk-flex-order-last-medium uk-flex-order-first-small\>\n\t\tSIDEBAR\n\t</div>\n</div>`\n
`@base-heading-margin-top:                       @global-margin-large;` That's why I'm used to it :) \nThis is in most YOOtheme templates I work with.. That's why I'm used to killing the headers top-margin all the time
In the screenshot is in the J3 backend... Well, they call it `bs` for a reason :)
@malles haha, in uikit we use the adjacent sibling selector. so the heading will never get a top margin if it is the first child ;-)
So, I little bit don't understand http://SSMaker.ru/d2c9e21b/
When I press LIST button, I have only `<li>` tags
Is it bug or feature?
What about `<ul>`
?
In Markup mode it works correctly
That's not the only problem, try to hit LIST button several times...
markup is broken
yeah.. It's a second question ;)
Anyone heard of the 'Roboto' google font acting up?\nSome sites that use is have all messed up fonts since a day or two..
So, I understand... Go to summernote for a while (
Hm... I came to http://getuikit.com/docs/modal.html and write in console \n```$(\#modal-spinner\).show();\n```. Class `uk-open` doesn't add to `uk-modal` block. But, if I click to neccessary button it's ok. What I do wrong?
try `UIkit.modal($(\#modal-spinner\)).show();`
OK, it's works. But on my site it shows Uikit is not defined
How I can define it? I use Master2 template
No idea? :(
ah, you are before 2.15
use `jQuery.UIkit.modal`
of `$.UIkit`if you have `$`
It works :)\n
I see that I have to update my system before start
Where I can see current version of uikit?
hmm difficult
I always look in the source, it's somewhere in the beginning :)
hang o
I found it in uikit.js
2.12
`jQuery.UIkit.version` should log it in console I think
ah, great
Can you use the switcher \next\ and previous option from buttons outside of the main container of the content? (data-uk-switcher-item=\next\)
Nope :( https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core/switcher.js#L52
the click is bound to the container of the switcher
>The modal component triggers an `show.uk.modal` event every time a modal is opened and `hide.uk.modal` when a modal is closed.
It's not true - `hide.uk.modal` works **before** modal closed, and it's important
In my view - it would be great to have 4 events - before close/open and after one like in BS
Shame, thanks @malles.
I tried to nest the switcher component, however using the next and previous options from within the child content cause the top most container to switch, not the immediate parent. is this normal or a bug? If it's normal is there a way to work around it so i can just switch the immediate items with next and previous? thanks in advance
Dont worry actually, its a trivial task to show and hide content so i just used simple $.show and $.hide. UI Kit is fantastic!
I was looking through the YooTheme theme demos the other day, and noticed an issue with the modal in Stage, I think it was.  I'm not a customer, so not really sure where to report it
this place is fine. thanks for reporting. what exactly is the issue?
http://yootheme.com/demo/themes/wordpress/2014/stage/?page_id=35
scroll down a bit, click the modal button
it sends you to the top of the page when the modal opens
not life altering, but inconsistent with how it works anywhere else.
Ok I see. yeah the default action isnt suppressed properly or the href should be set differently. thanks
Hi, i found a bug in Warp 7.3.2 in Wordpress - AJAX search is not working (tested on Master theme). In Warp 7.3.1 AJAX search works fine. 
Warp 7.3.2 uses UIkit 2.15 - it seems that there is a problem in its JS files. If you replace JS files (uikit.js and all components) with files from UIkit 2.12, AJAX search works again. With JS files from UIkit 2.13 and above it stops working.
Guys I hav a question about UIkit releases and WARP
How fast release of UIkit 
goes to WARP
and especcialy to Master2 theme
Would like to use UIkit for styling a email message, anyone already tried?
just forget it...
Due to Gmail and other email services that strip external resources, I need to use a \CSS inliner\
email is whole other ballpark
Yes, inline entire UIkit, might work :)
only CSS
tables, headers, text, buttons
no more
@malles do you suggest any \email framework\?
would like to style a order receipt, so some tables, some headers, two links, nothing else
i've been looking at some tools, but if you want to do it properly you need a whole build platform
I always fall back to my trusty `table` with some inline styls
well, just tried http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/
it seems to work perfectly
using only uikit CSS
When using uikit with composer, where do my css files go?
Okay I got it
What is the best way to tell gulp, put my minified files in an other folder?
hello anyone around now?
are you part of the uikit team @malles :-)
No, I just always forget to clase this tab :)
oh
are you familiar with uikit navbar?
fighting with it sometimes, yes
i am having a bit of trouble too, when the \position: fixed\ is applied to the navbar the element on it, the menu items, search bar offsets to the right, what kind of behavior is this?
unwanted :)\nFight with the inspector to find it. 
yeah I am looking at the inspector
Try to reproduce it in a jsfiddle or codepen. You often find the error while doing that. And if not, other people can check it out easily
it actually happens also for the uikit website, try to add \position:fixed\ on the navbar
Maybe you shouldn't add it :)\nWhy do you want to?
I figured it out, the padding-left gets inherited, so when it is fixed and is floating, the padding offsets the navbar, I think I can deal with this with GWT now
Why not use the sticky component to fix your menu? That handles it all for you
Yes I tried adding the sticky tag but it does not work 
Or maybe I am just missing something, 
you should add the components' css and js files as well
all components have their own js
What's the trick for putting a small image in a lightbox-modal?
The dialog has a fixed width of 600px, but my image is smaller...
Anyone?
@malles mmh, use the lightbox? :-P
Oke, you got me there
Lightbox component != modal with lightbox modifier.
I presumed that the lightbox modifier on the modal made it behave like a lightbox for single image.
@malles ok, I get it. I put it on the todo list. Let's see what we can do ;-)
I have one more for that to-do list. The new min-height of the modal-dialog fot the spinner makes my modal.dialogs too big. A modal-header, one line of text, and a footer with buttons is too small for the height, and leaves room at the bottom...
Not really important, but a bit annoying. Modal.dialog/modal.confirm are not documented. Wil they stay supported?
[![Screenshot_13.png](https://files.gitter.im/uikit/uikit/PY8X/thumb/Screenshot_13.png)](https://files.gitter.im/uikit/uikit/PY8X/Screenshot_13.png)
I've been trying to write long messages to get it to two lines... \Are you really, absolutely and very, very sure that you go and want to do this? You might regret it if you do!\
But that's no solution...
Nothin I can't fix with some custom-css and not worth an issue though
@malles try ```.uk-modal-dialog { min-height: 0; }```
I did :)
didn't work?
sure it did
That's why it's not an issue, just somethink you might rethink when working on the modal
only apply min-height to the spinner
Or even better, make the modal.dialog/confirm more robust and documented
yes, the min-height property should only be applied with .uk-modal-dialog-lightbox
Anyone else having Github-trouble?

Hello I want to ask if how can we make a text box to occupy 100% space when app goes mobile view. Currently the textbox in my app just occupy around 60-70 percent space.
My app contains some form fields that are displayed nicely in desktop view, when screen gets small and goes mobile view, the fields pile up vertically, but the width does not take up 100%
@kerbymart width is not a percentage, but a fixed value. you'll see that once your device width is less than 500 pixel, text field width will adapt to screen size

@robertotremonti Is this automatic for UIKit? My UIkit app does not behave this work, the textbox does not adapt. It is a separate plugin?
@kerbymart use the uk-width-* classes
@aheinze how about when form fields pile up there is no spacing in between. is there uk class for it?
@kerbymart what do you mean? I use `<div class=\uk-form-row\>` for each item and see gap between rows
`uk-form-width-large` is the class for text width
@robertotremonti thanks, that fixed it :-)
@robertotremonti however I am just wondering how to detect for mobile view in uikit, adding \uk-width-*\ in the form makes the desktop view look like mobile view, I am testing with Firefox where I can switch back in forth desktop view and mobile view
Why don't you simply resize browser window?
@kerbymart if you are using firefox, try ctrl+shift+m for resizing the window :) 
@robertotremonti Yes I am resizing the window. The problem is actually, applying uk-width-1-1 to a form field makes the desktop view forms look like mobile view,
the mobile view is just fine
@kerbymart  class=\uk-width-1-1 uk-width-medium-1-2\
hello, can anyone suggest how to make two uk-form-row pile up horizontal, like two textbox on the same row and still make \uk-width-1-1\ and \uk-medium-1-2\ work
placing it in a uk-grid invalidates the uk-width-1-1 and uk-medium-1-2
place `uk-width-1-1` and `uk-medium-1-2` to the grid, and `uk-width-1-1` to the inputs
@malles this doesn't make the inputs inherit uk-medium-1-2

hey, anyone online? I am having some struggle to make my footer be on top only if the page has not enough content to be bigger than one page-view. My best attempt so far: http://codepen.io/jeanleonino/pen/ZYyepE
but it is not so good if I don't know the content size =/ 
or the view height
didn't try, but I think I found the solution here: http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/
I try to use accordion. But I see that attribute `style=\display:none;\` applied to by root div (with `class=\uk-accordion\`). Maybe somebody knows, what's wrong?
http://SSMaker.ru/35e4919b/ - this is my chrome console. All works except this style..\n
I ran in to this.. You have Mootools loaded on that page?
Ithink Mootools toggles the div to invisible when event 'toggle' is fired
Excactly :) I'm not abel to use the accordion in J3 backends...
I'll try to kill it, thanks... But If is it normal - mootools in Joomla?
And I don't think it's really an UIkit issue they can prevent
It's still lingering round there... It should be gone lang ago, but is still loaded by default in admin...
it's frontend
J3.3?
Maybe a component load is... Kill it!
*loads it
yeah.. it's not easy :)\n
to kill it
Getting rid of the jui jquery and noconflict crap is even harder
I have a system plugin to reload all scripts, so (my) jQuery and UIkit are loaded first (and no Mootools!)
Something like that https://gist.github.com/malles/e335de7cf43fde0098c1
Thanks @malles, but, is it normal to  hack !Joomla for template works?
->continued in private chat
As result I killed Mootools for Accordion works. Pay your attention to this issue
Hello UIKit team, I'm sharing my work in progress with GWT (Java) and UIKit integration: https://github.com/kerbymart/gwtuikit
Its main goals: quickly integrate UIKit with a GWT project through Script Injection and to use UIKit features (add-ons) with GWT in a simple way. Like: UIKit.notification(\test\ UIKit.STATUS.SUCCESS, 5000, UIKit.POSITION.TOP_RIGHT);  See: https://github.com/kerbymart/gwtuikit/blob/master/src/test/java/com/getuikit/gwt/client/ComponentsTest.java
See: https://github.com/kerbymart/gwtuikit/blob/master/uikit-almost-flat/src/test/java/com/getuikit/gwt/client/ComponentsTest.java
Sorry to break your party guys, I cannot force uikit to work with php/Notebook++
looks my components are different than ones mentioned on Getuikit/docs/
Oh, I have no trouble with that.. :)
any hint guys? Where to llok for help or...
Sorry, I have no clue what you mean... :worried: 
Here are Uikit styles mentioned on page http://getuikit.com/docs/close.html which I don't have (I downloaded Uikit from their main page
And what does that have to do with your php Notebook ++ ??
Sorry for confusion, I make code in Notebook++, but I am not able to make Uikit css's work on my page
Check this out; http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_get-started.html#html-page-markup
I implemented those components into my page, but looks like I haven't classes mentioned on Components page, for example those mentioned here: http://getuikit.com/docs/button.html
@aheinze Hey, here's a #uikit and #gwt integration: https://github.com/kerbymart/gwtuikit
@kerbymart cool :-)
hi, I am relative beginner and would appreciate your kind help. UIkit js based utilities (accordeon etc) don't work on my php page. I included like they said: uikit.js and uikit.min.js (added even new jquery) but still nothing. 
@Dagge1 you need also to include js/components/accordion.js
hey many thanks @aheinze, it works now! Also looks like another problem was, including jquery.js had to be above uikit.js  JQuery was below it and it didn't worked
hello anyone up now?
i have a quick question, when dealing with off-canvas, when a off-canvas is shown and a menu is clicked, how to automatically swipe back to the main content, without waiting for the user to explicitly swipe the mobile page. There must be some javascript method in UIKit to call to make it swipe back?
I think you can control it like a modal, see the js-example on that page
thanks I will try that
@kerbymart you can call ```UIkit.offcanvas.hide()```\n
@aheinze yeah it works now thanks!
Any advise on the easiest way to show an iframe in a modal?
Could a plugin for the lightbox work? Any plans for that?
@malles it is not planned \u2026 but you can register a custom lighbox plugin to handle that. take a closer look at lightbox code: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/lightbox.js#L240
Yeah, was looking there
Register it on `init.uk.component`?
```javascript\nUIkit.on('beforeready.uk.dom', function(){\n\n    UIkit.plugin('lightbox', 'iframe', {\n\n        init: function(lightbox) {\n            //...\n        }\n    });\n\n});\n```
And where comes `lightbox` into scope here?
which lightbox?
no, nevermind, me being stupod :)
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/lightbox.js#L402\nAre there supposed to be double heght and width attributes there?
no :-O
there are more in the image and other plugins :worried: 
Do I see it right that the lightbox cache is only used for width and height of the content?
So I wouldn't need that for iframe with fixed size..
It's seems funny maybe, but I have a question about social icons. Whan about odnoklassniki.ru icon?
The icons of UIkit are form FontAwesome. Requests for new icons can be done here: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#requesting-new-icons
Best bet is +1 this one: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/1685
You have own styles, so, you can make own icons
What kind of browser support does UIkit have?
does uikit only have one class for text paragraphs to break on smaller screens than large?
the uk-heading-large class
do i have to add own breakpoints in my css to make it break for other paragraphs?
and why does uikit have sometimes have a padding of 25px? whats going wrong there?
@colindresj Scroll down [here](https://github.com/uikit/uikit/tree/develop) to see the browser support. The develop branch will be merged soon into the master.
Hello, I'm trying to apply a bigger margin when two elements are automatically stacked
From the documentation, I have to add \{cls:'.uk-margin-top'}\ to data-uk-margin attribute
http://getuikit.com/docs/utility.html#auto-margin
This option seems to break the functionality
Could you confirm?
try ```{cls:'uk-margin-top'}```
without the ```.```
`uk-margin-top` is added by default, to get a bigger margin you should add `\{cls:'uk-margin-large-top'}\`
ok, it works
there's an error in documentation
yep, it is fixed in the dev branch
@malles `uk-margin-small-top` is applied by default
And I talk crap.. :)
As I said. That part of doc is oke, and my head is not :)
But that will get you bigger margin :)
Hello, I'm trying to manually init lightbox on a bunch images on my page: 
`$(\a[href$='.jpg'],a[href$='.png'],a[href$='.gif']\).each(function() {\n\t\t\tUIkit.lightbox($(this), { group:'gallery' });\n\t\t})`
no luck ...
Can anyone help?
```$(\a[href$='.jpg'],a[href$='.png'],a[href$='.gif']\).attr(\data-uk-lightbox\ \{group:'gallery'}\u201c);```\n
Geilo! Vielen Dank, thanks a lot!
I wonder why my UIKit code does not work
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\uk-form-row\>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<label class=\uk-small-1-1 uk-large-1-10 uk-form-label\>Title: </label>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input class=\uk-small-1-1 uk-large-9-10 uk-large-1-2 uk-float-right\ type=\text\ value=\\ placeholder=\Title\>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>
I'm trying to build a Title row just like with StackOverflow title row
I think my code needs tweaking. uk-small-1-1 does not even trigger. When in small view, its not applying the 1-1 with, furthermore uk-large-* doesn't work too
try adding some `-width` and a `uk-grid` :)
I think you'll need more elements, and put the grid divs in the form-row. Combination of `uk-form-row` and `uk-grid` does not work well (I found out the hard way...)
I'd go for:
```\n<div class=\uk-form uk-form-row\>\n\t<div class=\uk-grid\>\n\t    <div class=\uk-width-large-1-10\>\n\t\t\t<label class=\uk-form-label\>Title: </label>\n\t    </div>\n\t    <div class=\uk-width-large-9-10 uk-form-controls uk-text-right\>\n\t\t\t<input class=\uk-width-1-1\ type=\text\ value=\\ placeholder=\Title\>\n\t    </div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n```\n
or throw in some flex-magic to get the vertical alignment nailed at once
This code makes the input text box overflows all to the right
Looks fine here http://jsfiddle.net/yq95ky9p/1/
I would like to execute some code when a Notify is clicked, but I can't see any triggered events in component code.
Am I missing something?
I've found a `onClose` option. Is that one?
yes, `onClose: function () { /* MY CODE */ }`
No, it's not the correct way. I want to execute some code when notify is acually clicked by user, not automatically closed by browser
How to do it?
You'll have to add your own listener for the notification
I solved using `notify.element.click(function () { /* MY CODE */ });`\n
I've just posted a request on github to add a `close.uk.notify` event
@robertotremonti see my answer to your request
@aheinze I've added a new request for notications :)
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/960
@malles thanks for the code tip yesterday,
I need to make an circle div. Not ellipse, but real circle. So, width of this block have to be equal to hight. Can you give me some advice?
@Ilya-Zhulin Make width and height equal and use uk-border-circle
I hoped for advice about how I can make it. Maybe there is some attribute already in uikit :)\n
Hi guys, I would like to create a responsive layout that has a (left) floating div in large devices while the div is stacked in small devices
What's the cleanest structure without having to double the code and use `uk-visible-*` classes?
That is default responsive grid behaviour; http://getuikit.com/docs/grid.html#responsive-width
Yes @malles but my div is floating inside a paragraph
It's a thumbnail for an article
I would like to keep it floating in large devices, while put it on top in small ones
text content in the paragraph flows around the thumbnail
divs are not allowed in paragraphs
sorry, meant a div with text inside
I have a div filled with text, a thumbnail is floating on top left
I want the thumbnail to be put on top in small devices
uk-float-left uk-width-small-1-1 ?
quite correct, but right and bottom margins (given by uk-float-left) are not removed in small devices
so you'll get a top thumbnail that has a right margin
margins only come with `uk-align-left`, `uk-float-left` is just the float
I was using the wrong rule
align-left
Thank you, @malles 
But that leaves you with no margin between image and text...
yes, I think I need to double the code and use uk-align-left for large devices and uk-width-1-1 for smaller ones
I should file a request on github to add a `uk-align-left-large` rule
That would be `uk-align-large-left`to be more consistent :)
But that was what I thought was missing here
Here it is. https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/969
Isn't `uk-align-medium-left` what you're looking for? Aligning left on tablet and bigger, and not aligning, leaving it stacked on small devices
Is it available?
that one exists
I AM AN IDIOT!
`uk-align-large-left` would be from 960px and up
We all are sometimes :)
please check http://getuikit.com/docs/utility.html
Thank you, @malles and @aheinze.
Unfortunately `uk-align-medium-left` is not enough. I can't get to have a fixed width floating thumbnail that goes on top on smaller devices.
When it goes on top, thumbnail width remains fixed and doesn't adapt to device width
Is there a way to limit a text length based on UIKit container width? Like:\n\n<p class=\uk-article-lead\ style=\margin-bottom: 0px;\><a href=\\ data-field=\title\>A very loooooooooooooooooooooooooooong text</a></p>
use the class ```uk-text-truncate```
Hi. I'm trying an autocomplit addon... Why when I type \Mosc\ I see not only Moscow, but Humburg and other? \Hamburg\ doesn't contain \Mosc\
@aheinze  cool thanks. that worked
@Ilya-Zhulin see https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/851
@aheinze this array isn't filtered? I see... thanks
@kerbymart Try the `uk-margin-bottom-remove` class for removing margin :)
@malles uk-margin-bottom-remove ?
@malles remove margin of?
of your `<p>`
your example with `style=\margin-bottom: 0px;\`
yeah, I've got a `style`-tag itch :)
@malles ah thanks for the tip
Can't get lightbox to work.
Modal appears, but image is not loaded
Could be due to linked image?
`<a href=\http://placekitten.com/g/800/600\ data-uk-lightbox=\{group:'my-group'}\><img src=\http://placekitten.com/g/800/600\></a>`
Do images need to be local?
add ```data-lightbox-type=\image\``` to the anchor
the href doesn\u2019t end with (gif|png|jpg)\u2026so the lightbox doesn\u2019t know what kind of resource it is
thank you, @aheinze it works
I should have read documentation more carefully
Anyone any idea why a slideshow won't get any width when it's in a `flex` of `float`?
[![Screenshot_30.png](https://files.gitter.im/uikit/uikit/a43B/thumb/Screenshot_30.png)](https://files.gitter.im/uikit/uikit/a43B/Screenshot_30.png)
@malles can you provide a link or jsfiddle where we can inspect the issue?
http://dhn.bixieprintshop.nl/
it's IP blocked though
I'll whitelist you
just keep refreshing :) 37.5.140.188?
@malles try ```header-left uk-flex-item-1```
looks like a chicken or the egg causality dilemma
the slideshow has a width of 100%
oke, that works :clap: 
But why????
and the initial flex item values are 0 1 auto (grow, shrink, basis) which means the box has the width of its content..\n
the parent is as big as the child and the child is as big as the parent ;-)
yeah, that's tricky...
Need to read up on the flex :) Seen a bit, but it can do so much more I guess
off to fight the navbars now :)
@malles flex: 1 is the same like: 1 1 0%  (grow, shrink, basis)\nwhich means space is allocated solely based on flex
uk-text-truncate truncates into single line, is there a way to truncate a very long text in 3 lines for example?
Is it possible to exclude some dates from the datepicker-selection?
@kerbymart with css you can only cut the text by combining height setting and overflow hidden. If you need ellipsis (and maybe 'read more' link?) you need something like [jquery.dotdotdot](http://dotdotdot.frebsite.nl/) plugin.
the file structure is so complicated... what i want to do is: i want to use the gradient theme
how can i do that?
the documentation is very poor, sad to say for such a good idea for a front-end framework
i have downloaded the git repo where the .less files from gradient are in a themes folder, but now i have a variables.less there and a global one, which one do i have to use?
i want to compile with gulp-less (only that, not that overloaded gulp config that comes with uikit)
and btw, there are no .scss files for the themes, right?
please tell me how to set up all the less files with the gradient theme without using the gulpfile.js from the official git repo
like what do i have to include where and so on
a good project is nothing without a good documentation
and the examples in the documentation don't even cover some basic things, like example code for an icon inside a button, it only mentions it
or some better explanation how the grid works and what has to be applied to get rid of the paddings/margins that tell you that something is wrong
don't implement new features, update the documentation first, that's the most important part of a project
here, the example with the icon button: <a href=\\><i class=\uk-icon-cog\></i> ...</a>
the \uk-button\ class is where? ... these little things make the difference
and maybe you should say something to the grid, some frameworks provide a class for thing that are lower than the smallest class
in case of uikit: uk-grid-width-small covers 480px and above
so you where thinking that you make EVERYTHING small from scratch, for screens smaller than 480px, and then apply the classes for higher widths
thats mobile first, yes, but some words about your workflow? nope, nothing found in the documentation
and i still don't know what is best practice to apply breakpoints for different font-sizes
an example like @media (max-width: ($breakpoint-small)-1) { <your-custom-stuff-for-smaller-fonts-here> } would be helpfull
you have put so much effort in this framework, but left the documentation and a good workflow instruction with a lower prio
now i have to try to find a way to make the gradient theme with ONE variables file work, so that everything is nice in one place
Sticky can not position in bottom????????
Anyone can explain me why modal has a min-height? If i use this for a short message (eg. a confim message), isn't very nice to see a lot of white space
It's for the spinner. It has been discussed before.
It may be better just to apply the `min-height` to the `uk-modal-spinner`, and not the default `uk-modal-dialog`
Please, can someone update doc? I lost off-canvas events ;-)
@adaniello Just tried moving the min-height from `uk-modal-dialog` to `uk-modal-spinner`, but that doesn't work..
It solves the problem of too large modals, but the spinner has no height now
I've read the chat back, a solution was suggested by Artur, I made that in a PR now: #982
Is there any page \made with uikit\?
what do you mean by page?
@jeanleonino http://getuikit.com/showcase/index.html
@saschadube yeah, I thought exactly about it later, I just never noticed the \send\ button there :-) 
my fault, I should be sleeping, lol.
oh, just yoothemes there basically, maybe the community needs to show what they are doing also :)
Hi all! I think, in UIKit not enough CSS class for fixing elements. :smile:  How about... for example **uk-position-fixed** ? :wink: 
@viocassel If it could be that easy... Fix where, in relation to what? Too complicatied for one class I guess....
i would add a drag & drop feature from off-canvas to an element in body; can anyone help me? any suggestions?
Everybody hello! Can somebody make a little quick example of usage `toggle.uk.accordion` function from http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_accordion.html? Please
```\n$('#myAcc').on('toggle.uk.accordion', function (event, active, toggle, content) {\n      console.log(active); //logs active element\n});\n```
untested :)
Can I ask your guys opinion in this issue:\nWhen I use templates via the UIkit template function, I set up the override like this:\n```\n            this.uploadTemplate = $('script[type=\text/uploadTemplate\]').html();\n            this.uploadTemplate = UI.Utils.template(this.uploadTemplate || this.options.uploadTemplate);\n```
Copied from other UIkit code.
This gives me issues in these areas of the template:\n```\n\t<a href=\\ class=\uk-modal-close uk-close uk-close-alt\></a>\n\t<img src=\{{thumb.lbox}}\ alt=\{{fileName}}\/>\n```
When loaded through `$('script[type=\text/uploadTemplate\]').html();` it is turned into\n```\n     <a href=\/\ class=\uk-modal-close uk-close uk-close-alt\></a>\n    <img src=\/{{thumb.lbox}}\ alt=\{{fileName}}\/>\n```
Note the slashes in `href ` and `src` attributes
I guess 'the browser' puts it there for some reason. I tried `$('script[type=\text/uploadTemplate\]').text();` instead, but that makes no difference.
Works now with `$('script[type=\text/uploadTemplate\]').text().replace(/=\\\//g, '=\')`, but I don't really like that...
Any ideas?
could you please  try ```$('script[type=\text/uploadTemplate\]\u2018)[0].innerHTML```
nope, same effect.
which browser?
Haven't really checked crossbrowser, I'm using Chrome
Could be an issue for UIkit if people use links in autocomplete template
do use it with joomla?
yes
But no Mootools active now
But why?
nope it\u2019s a content plugin, which tries to fix urls
Which plugin is that?
i'll have a look
Guy named Google seems to know these kind of things
:+1:  Thanks for the pointer
@Ilya-Zhulin Forgot to mention you, the answer scrolled up quite a bit :)
thanks @malles. I'll check it byself.
And next question - have somebody tried to make slideshow with thumbnails?
Maybe some ideas?
I heard something about it, they are working on it for Widgetkit as well. Someone opened an issue on it
no widgetkit
No, but it needs simular solution
So I guess it will be in UIkit soon as well
Very glade :)\n
OK, we'll wait
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/tree/feature/slideset
They are working on it \\o/
Sneak preview: http://prntscr.com/66ul8d :)
Build the branche locally for a working version :)
But thumbnails?!
If you put that in the bottom of a lightbox, it's thumbnails
hm.. It's a sync slidesets
it would be great
to support this feature
This is not what you mean?
I mean this http://SSMaker.ru/1f9ebc7c/
@aheinze Looks great!
It's a fansybox as you see
That is allready possible http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_lightbox.html#groups
Yes, but without thumbnails
Way fancier than fancybox! :+1: 
It's a last script which I use on my site
not from uikit
Get rid of it!
I think it's possible to upgrade group function a little bit and add the navigation for it
with dots or thumbs
It has the slidenav arrows as navigation
Yes, but you are understand what I mean
You could always show them with a css override
No
If you have 20 pictures
it's not comfortable to search them
You want to jump from 2 to 26 for examlpe
then you could use a slideset as navigation in the bottom
but you'll have to wait a bit
and how to sync them?
I think they'll account for that
Otherwise you could attach them via javascript
I hope for this
I use grid addon... I want to update grids on my page. 
```\njQuery(['data-uk-grid']).each(function(){UIkit.grid(this,'{gutter:15}');});\n```
whats wrong
grid `add-on` is only for sorting and searching, I believe
no
I See, looking at docs now\n
I use it for compact locate my pictures
like first example
But I have three tabs with separate grids
And after page reload grid builds only in active tab
Your code won't work, because the elements already have an instance of the grid attached
It's invivsible in next tabs
it will 'bounce off'
I see..'
That should be fixed when tab is selected, `check.uk.display` fires then
So, I have to make them \active\
excuse me?
Hang on, I'll check the code
Yeah, the switcher attached to the tab fires the `UI.Utils.checkDisplay` on the next slide (https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core/switcher.js#L157)
And that fires `display.uk.check` which grid listens to (https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/grid.js#L78)
em.... And what I have to do?
Check if you're using the tabs/switcher combination correctly
it's working
with instruction from site
You could try adding `data-uk-check-display` to the surrounding div (http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#data-check-display), but that should not be necceserry\n``` \njQuery(['data-uk-grid']).each(function(){\n     UIkit.grid(jQuery(this)).updateLayout();\n});\n```
Oh.. I'm using `div` in content instead of list
That you could try too, but not sure if that works, and again it should not be nessecary
Is it important?
You can place divs in the `li`'s, but there should be a `ul` that is the switcher
Just a minute... I'm changing. It's from bootstrap tabs
no, it doesn't metter
According to the code, it should work with nested divs as well.
Than try te recreate it in a fiddle
you'll find the error, or you'll have a good example for an issue
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'defaultView' of undefined 
This is an answer
ah, something is just blocking the s
defaultView doesn't sound like UIkit code
animation in tabs?
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=defaultView
empty
I have to make some update
after I resize a browser grid shows
That fires `display.uk.check` as well
Can I play this function manually?
Try typing `UIkit.Utils.checkDisplay()`
in console
it outputs all the elements it checked
it showed
But again, if that doesn't fire, the problem is in the tab/switcher
but grid is hidden
what kind of problem&
You should pass the element as well `UIkit.Utils.checkDisplay($('#tabs'))`
Reading the code a bit better, you do need `data-uk-check-display` attribute on your tab-div
tab li
I changed it to `li`
yeah sorry
hang on
Have I add this attr to tab list or to tab content list?
It's all about this: http://getuikit.com/docs/documentation_javascript.html#data-check-display
\To do so, add the data-uk-check-display attribute to the elements which need to be recalculated.\\nThat would be your element with the `data-uk-grid` attribute
\This is not needed for the Grid, it's triggered by default.\ Seems not to be true\nThat goes for `data-uk-grid-match` and `data-uk-grid-margin`, not for `uk-grid-itself`
That is an error in the docs
THANK YOU!!!
It's working now
Oh... You saved a day of my life :) 
And stopped your girlfriend crying again? :)
I'll create an issue for the docs
No, my wife is sleeping about three hours already
It's 1:11 of night
I have to sleep also.
Thank you, really. 
No prob :+1:  Is hobby for me, instead of gaming. This is much better. I'll go back to my own bugs now :)
Yeah, websites for  me also instead of \World of tanks\
Good night. I'm going to bed
Bye :+1: 
hi, fellas. did you know that by setting handleClass on uk-sortable you can actually have a sortable inside another sortable? really surprised me. =)
@malles @Ilya-Zhulin The next UIkit release will have a new thumbnav component :wink: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/core/thumbnav.less
@saschadube selectors like ``.uk-thumbnav > * > * > img`` make me think somebody's feeling shy about adding new classes. it probably also limits ways one might extend markup in the future.
@constb yeah, we are torn about it. do we really need an item class?  Are there any real cases it would be a different markup?
if we add an item class, we have to do it for all navs (subnav, dotnav, tab, breadcrumb, pagination)
@saschadube hard to know this upfront.\nI didn't know I would ever want uk-grids as a nestable's items but then I did and it appeared to be somewhat buggy, ended up using sortable instead.\nAlso a sortable inside a sortable - this one worked, although delegated click events on buttons inside sortable's items didn't.\nWhen it comes down to markup - sometimes strange thing come into designers' minds... =)
@malles @zslabs We are wrapping up a new UIkit release. Is there anything which still needs to be fixed?
Check the lightbox doc html, still 3 `lighbox`typo's and a closing tag error in it #974 
the PR is broken, after the add-on component switch
@malles Thanks! Are you creating a new pull request or should I just fix it right away?
I wasn't :) 
I think I'll be in your way :)
In examples throughout the docs the links refer the the core components as \In our example we used panels from the Panel component.\
That's a bit weird, especially with the grid component, which is an add-on...
But I see the difficulty, since they all are (core-)components
hello using Javacript is it possible to make UIKit modal show in the center and with no slide animation?
@kerbymart You can show modal like this: http://getuikit.com/docs/modal.html#javascript
just add options: `var modal = UIkit.modal(\.modalSelector\ {center: true})`
The animation is in the css, unavoidable when adjusting the top for centering. You can clear the transition in the `.hook-modal-dialog`\nhttps://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/less/core/modal.less#L131
@saschadube I'm very glad and waiting for it. Then my sites will be made only by uikit without any other scripts :)\n
HI @Ilya-Zhulin Your thumbnail-wishes may be coming true very soon :)
It's important maybe - during several realeases my NetBeans shows a mistake in accordion.less file. String 54 - `;` is missed
Semicolons are always important :)
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/986
@malles adding {center: true} does not work not sure why
I put it and forgot :). But yesterday I updated uikit in Master tamplate and saw it again
@kerbymart no, because it has to be on the button, not the modal... hang on http://jsfiddle.net/malles/TYVta/19/
@malles My app is not triggering the modal with a button. Its more like this: var modal = $wnd.UIkit.modal(el, {center: true}); \nThen, modal.show();
I see, working on another Pen now, this fiddle was buggy. codepen.io/anon/pen/qENvXK
@malles I need to debug my app, its not centering vertically, what property should I look at in the inspector?
position: relative; ?
I would use a unminimised version of uikit and add breakpoint https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core/modal.js#L96 here
Then see if `this.options.center` is true
@kerbymart It all depends on when you first instanciate a modal to that element, and with what options.
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qENvXK?editors=101
in the pen you can see that the options in the default UIkit button (which you won't use) are not working (modal is centered, options says false), because the modal and the options are already set in the javascript on 'ready.uk.dom`
You can however in your js manipulate the options of the instance en make the modal center or not.
Seems like a bit of a hack though
And not entirely true, you can get it centered, but not back to the top again...
@franziskaschulz You might want to merge this one as well: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/947
@malles done. thanks!
Looking forward to the release
I like it how you tend to sneak in a new feature branche just before a release :)
just stuff that isn't ready for release yet ;)
@saschadube  Would love another look at my border-box stuff ;) https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/948
but to be perfectly honest, my most recent reply is something that I'd love some attention on https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/798#issuecomment-75019177
@zslabs Thanks, will take a look at it :smiley: 
With `.uk-visible-hover` I can show an element when hovering on its container.
http://getuikit.com/docs/utility.html#visibility-utilities
Is there a way to hide it? I'm trying to \replace\ a button when hovering on a panel.
Something like \Hover me\ blue button that changes to \Yes!\ green button.
Is there any documentation on how to recieve the order of sortables?
It's not passed in the event, you'll have to get them yourself
Here is an example https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/962
So if I want to have that back on my php I'd go for a hidden form thing @malles ?
Yeah, something like that. Or post it via ajax
You mean on every change?
depends on how your app works, yes
Maybe create a confirm button that does the post.
Yeah, I think I'll go with that
Many thanks @malles that really bothered me for quite some time now
No prob! Keep on coding!
I'll do, it's more fun then ever, thanks to Laravel 5 :D
if you send it via ajax, you can skip the hidden inputs, and save the ordering as data-attribute
I'm very bad with ajax and js in general
That is the last piece you'll need to tie all things together. Like this
Oke, you got me going.. codepen.io/anon/pen/MYVqab
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ByrGOM - why it doesn't work?
Click to `http` link please, not to `https`
I tried to change `toggle` parameter and got error
I see, that script doesn't know `toggle` parameter :). You can change it as you wish, but `.uk-toggle-title` class works only
@malles @Isigiel just added a serialize method to the sortable object: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/develop/src/js/components/sortable.js#L496
\nSortable list:\n\n```html\n<ul id=\mySortable\ data-uk-sortable>\n    <li data-id=\1\ data-name=\test\>...</li>\n    <li data-id=\2\ data-name=\test2\>...</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nafter calling ```$('#mySortable').data('sortable').serialize();``` you'll get this:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\id\:1, \name\:\test\},\n    {\id\:2, \name\:\test2\}\n]\n```
@aheinze Nice!
`item = UI.$.extend({}, UI.$(this).data());` That takes every data-attribute of element en makes an object? Nice!
sure it does `data()` gets it all...
btw. nestable has also a serialize function
@Ilya-Zhulin Accordion does have a `toggle` option. Your syntax was wrong, use colon, not equal sign. `{toggle='.acc-toggle'}` => `{toggle:'.acc-toggle'}`
 @aheinze That is very usefull!
Will there be a Grand Price for the one that opens issue #1000 ?:)
Still not all old events are gone from docs... #997 
Those are already fixed, but I found another one
I'll try to get it in as PR #1000 :)
@aheinze http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_slideshow.html#captions \Just include the caption.js file...\. We don't have that one, do we?
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/docs/addons_slideshow.html#L428
@nstaeger captions are gone \u2026 docs are already updated
Really looking forward to this release. Will this be version 3.0?
@malles of course... Epic fail :(... Thanks
Hmm... Nice markdown parser https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/ :smile: 
how to unbind or update datepicker minDate?
Another amazing update guys, thank you :)
http://getuikit.com/docs/addons.html
Grid and flex links broken :(
Refreshing solves it
Had the same
old links to /addons in your cache
Perfect, thank you @malles :P
I am really excited about this release,  a lot of new items including gutter collapse
glad you like it ;-)
Please thank the team. It is a joy to use UIKIT.
@aheinze @saschadube You guys ever considered witching to more of a BEM syntax https://en.bem.info/ ? For example, instead of 'uk-text-center' it'd be 'uk-text--center'. I've been using it on all projects moving forward and have really enjoyed it -- much more readable
Congrats on the release BTW!
All that docs reloading ...
@zslabs Again, torn :wink: Isn't it making writing code too complicated? You have to know, is it a modifier or is it a sub object... But sure, we are open for discussion
@saschadube It's definitely a different mode of thinking, but I've found it to actually simplify writing and reading this code later. Think about the use-case of \uk-button uk-button-large uk-button-primary\ I think it's much easier to digest as \uk-button uk-button--large uk-button--primary\. That way, there's no confusion on what actually is modifying another class or what is a separate component all together
And while not a huge issue in UIkit (as you guys have done a great job with it), but it keeps nesting styles really low, because the specificity of your CSS is written and consumed in a way that makes it more natural to separate these pieces as needed
@zslabs that would be a matter of opinion, I get on just fine with the current classes. Think about what UIKIT users would have to adjust to a new set of rules.
@alexdevine It would be only for discussion for UIkit 3. 
@alexdevine Agree on the opinion part, that's why I brought it up ;) If you were to have a list class item like \.subnav-link\ I think it's easier to read as \.subnav__link\. You can see what the main component is and that this \link\ part is directly tied to that component. You can actually do some pretty sweet nesting (without it being \nesting\) in LESS if you want to keep things clearer. I'll whip up a codepen
it's definitely a matter of taste :wink: 
http://codepen.io/zslabs/pen/wBBbbq already had somethin ;)
but you could do the same with components instead of the prefix here
I see what you are saying, maybe I'm just being a boring sod and stuck in my ways HAHA!
I find there are already so many and I love simplicity. one of the reasons I moved away from BS over to UIkit was how easy and packed the framework is to use all under one core.
@saschadube @zslabs I can see the difficulty in this. As a developer I would opt for the BEM, but for usability for the enduser I go with the current classes. The 'regular' uikit-user does not have to now about components, modifier and subclasses.
ha no worries, I'd actually be surprised if there were no objections as it is different than what we all grew up learning, but I think the best advice I can give is to give it a shot in a small project. There's definitely that whole \what's a component, what's a modifier\ type of learning-curve, but overall it makes coming back to the code much more enjoyable and sustainable. Plus remember, not \every\ class really is a component or needs a modifier
@malles So it sounds like for you personally, you'd rather it be BEM, but are afraid of the consequences that could create for the end-user using it?
@zslabs Kindof. I like the LESS trick you did there. But it's like @alexdevine said, most users of UIkit like the 'easier'-looking layout of markup and classes. Most users of Uikit will never open, let alone edit a less file. So I guess it's also a matter of what group of users UIkit wants to target.
In more developer-specific frameworks, eg cockpit, I would say the BEM way would be logical (if it had a frontend :) ).
Let's also not assume that the average developer couldn't decipher the code though -- at the end of the day, most \beginner\ users to the framework are simply copying from the docs anyways
True. So it's down to a matter of taste again :).
Any thoughts given to the SVG conversion yet? I've been using http://zslabs.com/articles/svg-cool-kids and http://zslabs.com/articles/svg-cool-kids very reliably over the past few months. https://github.com/jkphl/gulp-svg-sprite has also been great
hello guys, someone can give me a help? I want to use the sass version of uikit, but when I generate the .scss files, the gradient theme are not available on dist folder. It's  possible to generate the themes files too? (using the default .gulpfile)\nThank you.
hello all, I believe the Addons section of the documents on your website are down.
http://getuikit.com/docs/addons_slideshow.html and other are giving a 404
They are not only down, they don't exist anymore :)
The doc-site has changed, and /docs/addons is now /docs/components
`Ctrl-F5` on the main page should refresh the menu-links
Or clear browser cache
sorry for the trouble
Nevermind, derp
haha, what was the error?
Hey Everybody - Anybody ever tried to use the form-password with the show/hide AND an Icon? having trouble getting the alignment to work
I'm afraid to ask - what about updates of Master template?
@florianletsch I \typoed\ :)
Can I check in JS - is lightbox (or another component) included or not?
All core components are in uikit.js, all add-ons (like lightbox) need to be loaded seperatly
Yes, but I want to check - is it loaded or not?
You can check if plugin excists by typing `UIkit.components.lightbox` in the console
Did I say add-ons, I meant components :)
Yes, I see... I can check `typeof` of it for `undefined`
Thanks!
For `undefined` you don't need `typeof`. Just `if (UIkit.components.lightbox !== undefined) {//go}`
`typeof var.that.is.undefined === 'undefined'`, while `var.that.is.undefined === undefined`. Typeof gives a string 'undefined', while the var itself === `undefined` without quotes
Hm... I have to make `modal background` transparent to have Lightbox like in example... But how I have to use Modal, if background is transparent?
Sorry.. Problem was in styles
Everybody hello! A question about datepicker
The goal is - to write a date to MySQL database. For this I need UNIX format of time. Maybe rework this script to out UNIX value of date?
Maybe some advice to use it in reality? it's very seldom needs to use date as string
And also - if the field value is 00-00-00, it seems that date have to be Now(). What do you think about it?
@Ilya-Zhulin That really depends on how your backend manages the data. The system provides the value for the field, and handles it's storage in the db. Any conversion should be done there..
And what about second suggestion?
Same really.. the value 0000-00-00 comes from the server. It should replace it for a default value. 
Really, if I have `datetime` format of database field I can't have empty value
In a way you don't want your datepicker altering your data for you..
Now I little bit understand, that I have to make some Joomla field with operations with value to use this component..
Yeah, I try to use the default calandar-field of Joomla, because it handles all the conversion and displaying
Be glad that you don't have to pick the time, and you have to account for timezones :)
I work with SEBLOD component it hase own fields... But it seems the same
@/all We released UIkit 2.17 https://yootheme.com/blog/2015/02/23/uikit-217-released
Thanks for the hard work!\nIs it enough to just include the tooltip.js as JavaScript source file or should I do something with the CSS as well? Because my tooltips are positioned incorrectly.
also include the less/css file  in `components/`folder
thanks! that worked!
@saschadube and @aheinze Still noticing some wonkiness in the datepicker. If you set the input to a \date\ type then Chrome's native datepicker kicks in and doesn't allow the datepicker to work
Here's the relevant discussion https://plus.google.com/+GoogleChromeDevelopers/posts/hTcMLVNKnec
Latest 2.17.0 introduces `manualclose.uk.notify` and `close.uk.notify` events for notify component
@saschadube @aheinze Looks like setting the input to readonly when \text\ type is used should work. disables the native iOS keyboard, but click events still work
It doesn't seem to work
I'll add that to the relevant issue I saw on github
    var notify = $.UIkit.notify(...
    var notify = $.UIkit.notify(...
    notify.on('manualclose.uk.notify', function () {});
we will take a look at it
@saschadube are you talking with me? :smile: 
@robertotremonti sorry, to @zslabs :grin: 
@robertotremonti can you add it as issue on Github and we will take a look :smile: 
Just to be sure, is that the correct way to use the event?
@robertotremonti the event is fired on the notification element itself, and the var `notify` is the parent 'class'
$this->item->productID
Wrong paste :)
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/notify.js#L78
try `notify.message.on('manualclose.uk.notify', function () {});`
@robertotremonti the correct whay would be $(\u2018.yourlement\u2019).on(..)
@malles `notify.message.on` is undefined
sorry, my fault
@malles `notify.element.on` is the correct way
Thank you, guys
@robertotremonti That's what I meant, sorry
Thank you, @malles 
@saschadube I think my last comment in https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/1006 should do it
OK, I've made a plugin for Datepicker and started to use it.. It's awful to choose birthday in 1934... maybe it is possible to make a year editable?
@Ilya-Zhulin you can include form-select before the datepicker to make the year selectable
just click on the year / month name :)
Ammm... Excuse me.. 
I don't understand exactly
http://getuikit.com/docs/datepicker.html
try to click on the \u201cyear\u201d or the \u201cmonth\
in the first example ;)
Kick my brain... Why I have no it?!
read the paragraph before the first example, you need to inlude the form-select component before the datepicker one
Hm.. I see now.. Sorry, I'll try. It's hard to be attentionally in foreign lang
no worries, it happened to me too that\u2019s why i knew :) although i would make the \u201cselectable\u201d ui more intuitive @saschadube by displayhing somethign that hints to the fact that the month / year are selectable. Maybe a uk-icon-caret-down?
Yes, I're write

Flex seems to be broken on demosite on Chrome. FF and IE are fine..
Is that just me?
http://getuikit.com/docs/flex.html
Nope, it's weird markup
But why it only shows on Chrome, is mystery...
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/pull/1008
Hi, will the yoo master2 template get an update with the new uikit 2.17?
Yeah, does master theme now has actual uikit 2.17?
@proweb no, it has not. i looked 10 minutes ago and its still 2.15.0
Hm. So whats the delta time then UIkit goes to Master Theme?
@proweb @StefanVirus Update is coming in the next 2 days :smile: 
\u041e\u041a, thanks for answer @saschadube 
@saschadube can you please change the version or date in your theme download section? i allways need to download the theme to check if its new
Yeah
date frozen
forever
and it doesn't change
[![blob](https://files.gitter.im/uikit/uikit/WK7H/thumb/blob.png)](https://files.gitter.im/uikit/uikit/WK7H/blob)
this appeared on hacker news today. looks like it's based(?) on uikit: http://www.html5depot.com/blackhole/
(@saschadube see above)
uikit team this package - https://packagecontrol.io/packages/UIkit%20autocomplete\nhave actual uikit version markup ?
yes
that package offers autocomplete for all uikit classes and data attributes for the recent uikit version 2.17.0
@saschadube did you notice that AJAX search is not working on current version of Master Theme? Hope that upcomming version will correct this.
@saschadube @aheinze This issue is closed -- but still seeing it. I have a workaround, but would like something like this in the core https://github.com/uikit/uikit/issues/587#issuecomment-75762995
@zslabs I\u2019ll take a second look on that
@aheinze thanks man, really appreciate it
In modal component you can set it to be shown at center with `center:true` option in data attribute
How do you set it if it's shown via JS?
    $.UIkit.modal('#my-modal').show();
```$.UIkit.modal('#my-modal\u2018, {center:true}).show();```
what a stupid I am
Thank you
is `$.UIkit` still needed or can I safely use `UIkit` without jQuery dollar symbol?
 ```$.UIkit``` is deprecated 
use just UIkit
Ok, thanks
Is there a way to change color of modal header/footer using preset primary, success, warning classes?
Nesting a panel inside the footer is not the right way because it has padding and borders
Hi all, not sure if i've found a bug or something is wrong my end, but I've got a UIkit.$doc.on('hide.uk.offcanvas') listener, however this fires twice when closed, anybody got ideas?
The question is, does it fire twice, or are you listening twice?
maybe, i'll give it a lookie
Set a breakpoint in the browser on yourr listener init. See if that fires twice
on that note however, if you have 3 offcanvas elements, is it possible to listen for the close event on that element, rather than the whole doc, coz when you close any of the offcanvases it triggers
The event passes the active panel and bar as arguments: https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core/offcanvas.js#L51
yeah, so will need to have a switch in the listener, rather than just listen on that object
Yep. All eventsfor the canvas are triggered on the doc itself
okay thanks
Any ETA for UIkit 3.0? Just to plan future projects.
How do you add both filter and sort controls in a dynamic grid?
With separated controls, one left-aligned and one right-aligned, not in the same `ul` list
I've got a div that has overflow: scroll on it, and the items inside have uk-scrollspy on them, however they only animate in when the main document scrollbar/window triggers an event, if i scroll down the div, it doesnt fire
Scrollspy only listens to the main scroll event
You'll have to attach the scrollspy listener to the scroll of your div
do you have an example of how i'd achieve that please?
Was afraid of that :)
Hang on
https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/core/scrollspy.js#L29
Scrollspy fires on `\scrolling.uk.document\` on `$doc`
so if i create a listener on my div - then fire that event? it should trigger the animations?
So something like\n```\n$('#yourel').scroll(function () {\n       UIkit.$doc.trigger(\scrolling.uk.document\);\n});\n```
Could do the trick
Not a promise, though :)
ha yeah i'm just whipping it very similarly, fingers crossed!
 ````\nsidebar.find('.uk-offcanvas-bar').on('scroll', function(){\n        UIkit.$doc.trigger(\scrolling.uk.document\);\n    });\n```1\nseems to do the job!
hmm well that message was disapointing
Can I set more than one `data-uk-filter` for a Dynamic Grid element?
Like a t-shirt that is both \large\ and \red\. Similar to a tags behavior.
`data-uk-filter=\large,red\`
I'd say, tr it :)
According to [this line](https://github.com/uikit/uikit/blob/master/src/js/components/grid.js#L216), it would work
Yes, this is what I was looking at.
But is it working?
It works, thank you.
It was you that said it first :)
I need to make a date picker like this
http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/
with checkout dynamically updatable as the checkin
can someone help ?
with uikit, off course
I'm not sure if that's possible. You'll have to manually set min-max date and update value of the picker.
update.uk.datepicker not examples
i need examples for learn it
Always talking about Dynamic Grids, is there a way to dinamically refilter elements once a `uk-data-filter` attribute is changed by JS?
@robertotremonti That's kind of pushing it...
or removing
@datelpiro For UIkits javascript part there are not many docs or examples.
a filtered grid of \bookmarked\ panels. once a bookmark is removed on one panel, it disappears from the filtered view
@datelpiro Start with manually initing [doc](http://getuikit.com/docs/datepicker.html#javascript-options) the datepicker, and see what you can do with that var
@robertotremonti Oke, I can see that :)
It seems to be grabbing the data value, and filtering [each time after click on the filter](http://getuikit.com/docs/datepicker.html#javascript-options)
Does the grid update when you toggle the filter after removing the bookmark?
also, following @robertotremonti comment, it\u2019s possible to use both ```data-uk-filter``` and ```data-uk-sort``` at the same time? Currently it doesn\u2019t seem so
@Skullbock yes, you can
you need to wrap your ul controls inside a div
ah, that\u2019s great to hear :)
thanks ;)
i tried without success, i\u2019ll use your suggestion ;)
one UL for sort and one for filter, both inside a DIV with ID=controls (or something else)
this ID is to be passed to grid init
ah, but i mean to \u201cclick\u201d on the same <li> and have the grid filtered AND ordered
@malles yes
@Skullbock yes, it should work
ok, thansk!
Try triggering the `filter` function mannually
@Skullbock\n    <li data-uk-filter=\A\ data-uk-sort=\B\>X</li>
pushed new launcher/xenko, let me know if you run into any issues
After updating the launcher lost all previously created projects
possible since we store this data in a Silicon Studio folder before
reopening them manually should readd them
again, don't forget to backup :)
Can't wait to see blueprints and guides for the engine that should be next step
Does the update do an unisntall of the old silicon version?
I expect you might have to readd .xksl/.xkfx/.cs to csproj manually (we don't handle them properly in automatic upgrade)
@dfkeenan no it works side by side (except maybe connection router might be little bit lost, but well)
OK
an idea to ease the LFS load might be to split the samples off into their own optional repo
https://twitter.com/xenko3d/status/1024905973712936960
hashtag all the things~
@DW01 yes, I was considering a few options like this (another one would be to use a LFS server in a different location, seems possible), but I was waiting to see  how much it will be before doing time consuming things like this
ha yes, let me repost it
Might want to change the account's bio, too :P
Include gitter chatroom bring in some traffic :D
@e102em i see you on facebook lol
Feel free to add :D and yes Im die hard Xenko fan
go full xen, switch forums to xenforo :U\n\ni kid
Probably the perfect time to start game development vlog but im a 3D generalist so coding part would be pure noob 
Im hoping my current programmer would reconsider Xenko
https://twitter.com/xenko3d/status/1024906814196875265
Wonderful ^_^
But yeah @xen2 may want to drop SS from the Twitter account's bio
good catch, thanks
:thumbsup: 
I am ready to help with the creation of beautiful scenes and animated videos. However, I can't help editing the code and creating some new features
I need to recreate the upgrade mechanics from sonic adventure 2 and the tv prop assist. :) Im not to far off from getting some level design content for this title
man, sonic. I wish my PS3 remote wasn't dead, otherwise I'd go play Generations again
Phantasy Star meets sonic adventure 2 meets mirror's edge and capcom's remember me 
that's an exciting-sounding mashup
I remember blinding myself on many occasions playing ME over at a friend's house
Also generative level system :P
Clean Cyberpunk game really made free running cool
Hi there! After quietly following everything here I am exited to try Xenko again. I also already support Virgile on Patreon.
Getting my name on the xenko page sure would look good on the portfolio :eyes:
That would be cheating though would have to contribute 3D assets or something
@xen2 I think we should start small. To begin with, set specific goals and update the roadmap
https://trello.com/b/FwbjOjjB/xenko-roadmap
yes the roadmap is completely outdated
should probably start fresh
Time to update roadmap maybe do a todo list for current groups to speed up development?
Yeah, I think we need to create a new road map.
@e102em Yes, and to understand what needs to be done and what to achieve in the future and what the community and specific people are working on in particular
In the old road map, everything is done well enough
Would stress the importance of cloth physics ~
I suppose the roadmap would be for reference only. I don't want to close doors to people who might want to contribute in specific areas (as long as they lay their plan in advance to avoid conflicts/design issues)
I will get started on it soon, I will probably ask for community to vote/discuss
Of course, I'll be happy to help
:D if you need 3D modelist im here as well
anyway, thank you everybody for your support so far
wouldn't have had the motivation to continue working on it if there was no community
:D new management is new 
(even though it's been pretty damaged with the long wait)
time to rebuild anew!
make Xenko Seagreen over red :o But likes the red
Also does the new update come with the industrial robot an that boss?
Silicon Studio agreed to release some of the demo done in the past, they will be put on github or somewhere in the next weeks
so the industrial robot should be one of them if I remember correctly
Im guessing that can't be used for commercial use though. Wouldn't mind beating them up :D
It would be awesome to see new projects and see how it's done.
especially  industrial robot
https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/93x4en/xenko_c_game_engine_is_now_fully_opensource_mit/
waiting for the roadmap
@xen2 use github project for roadmap/ideas 
@amerkoleci yes I wanted to give a try to use mostly github for project management
and see how far it gets us
Nice one, I would gladly contribute here as well, I've done lot of job in keeping SharpDX with new features
And working on vulkan binding as well
Has anyone tried to run the new game template on UWP?
doesn't work? I expect some platforms to be temporarily broken (i.e. no iPhone at home yet)
now that release is done, there's lot of things to automate/fix/check
When trying to call Game.Run(new GameContextUWPXaml(SwapChainPanel)) I get this exception: System.TypeInitializationException: 'The type initializer for 'Xenko.Core.IO.VirtualFileSystem' threw an exception.' with the inner exception being a NotImplementedException. Also, it can't locate the assembly Xenko.Video.\n
ok, I will take a look at it
thanks
Be sure to set the target and minimum version to the latest one (Build 17134) because the build set by default is 10240 and the debugger can't handle that for some reason.
Are there plans to move to .Net Core?
I can finally go back to the editor code. Lots of stuff I wanted to do before leaving Silicon Studio...
.net core is already supported no?
oh so you are part of the team :)
I know nothing about Xenko tbh
I just noticed the editor is not .net core
Well there is no .net core UI so...
I have lots of question I'm going to be boring sorry ^^
how does Xenko deals with the gabage collector?
I actually planned to move from WPF to some new xplat UI (such as Avalonia) but that would be a lot of work and Avalonia is not quite there yet.
Eto.Forms is another option, which is not bad at all
Project [Gemini](https://github.com/tgjones/gemini) is very nice too but a little hard to use
nevermind, it's WPF I forgot
made my first issue: #2 
.NET Core 3.0 will support WPF and WinForms.
there is electron with .net, avalonian, eto (gtk)
for .net core
I would also be quite happy to switch to a more cross platform system, but for sure we would need several dedicated people over a few months for that, editor code is quite massive -- so not sure we focus our limited resources on that right away, more something for later when we have bigger community & resources (except of course if a group of people is highly motivated right away!)\n(also some other part of the editor/asset pipeline would need some additional work  to work properly on all platforms)
it's something I always considered to do at some point if Xenko was growing in popularity (esp. since macOS moved away from deprecated OpenGL, it seems less daunting)
Yeah the main issue is the build system. Even if we have a xplat editor, moving from MSBuild is also gonna be a huge task.
@xen2 probably need metal backend support first
Ideally the editor should run with Xenko's own UI (+ additional features like data binding). But that's an even bigger task :)
Or use MoltenVK.
FYI there is an effort to move from our current C# shader system impl (slow & complex) to a glslang/SPIRV-Cross based fork
which is 100x of times faster
and should allow us to target Metal shaders too
(if we don't use MoltenVK, which is probably much easier to deal with esp. with our limited resources)
anyway, this glslang/SPIRV-Cross effort was well underway and I would like to finish it as it will allow us to get rid of lot of custom code to maintain, and speed up editor/runtime quite a lot
It would be nice if you could make UI in Xenko with XAML, as the current implementation is already similar to WPF and I currently enjoy using it in UWP.
@xen2 what would that mean for existing shaders? would you drop the xenko shading language?
Eto.forms is not bad, just docking is missing
There is imgui.net as well
Otherwise Avalonia had WIP docking library 
@tebjan no, it would still be the same Xenko shader language, but a new runtime implementation of it
sounds great
What about HLSL?
Hi. I'm trying to build the project from VS2017 but it fails on Xenko.Core. What should be the default build configuration? I have Debug/Mixed Platforms
Actually it complains that xenko\\deps\\LLVM\\clang.exe is not compatible with x64 version of Windows
Look into the .csproj File of your project, there you can see in each PropertyGroup what configurations and platforms it supports.
@Aminator9000 Xenko Shading Language is based on HLSL (an extended version with classes and inheritance, data streams, etc)
@Aminator9000 yes, it would convert XKSL => SPIR-V  => whatever language we want (HLSL, GLSL, SPIR-V as is, Metal, etc...)
the idea is to work at bytecode level rather than source AST level (much more efficient and straightforward)
I see.
So much activity. :D Lets hope it keeps up.
Nevermind. My fault - I didn't have new version of Git supporting LFS - thanks for pointing this in build instructions. 
As expected Gamesfromscratch has already made a video about Xenko 3.0.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_C6xmwHLTc
haha so fast
reposting what i said in other chat:
@makotech222\nWas hoping to see more bugfixes/features after a year :(\nWill try and upgrade my game after work today tho :)
:O Even @Kryptos-FR is back. Have not seen you around much. Hope to see you get back involved.
Now I find myself asking. Do I bother upgrading XenkoToolkit to 3.0. Or try get some of it directly into Xenko.
probaby into xenko
your toolkit was very useful for me already :)
RE: shaders, would definitely appreciate more tutorials on that after the rewrite. It was super hard for me to try and write xenko shaders, esp for someone's first time writing shaders. Couldn't really port anything from any other game engine.
@dfkeenan if you keep it in your own nuget, you can have your own release schedule. 
There is some stuff in thee I really think should be in the engine. And if I put it into Xenko. It's no longer my problem. :wink: 
@Aminator9000 He's always fast lol.
So much activity :)
We should try to recruit https://github.com/mellinoe
re: UI; if we wanted to take a time machine to use docking with eto, there's gfcdock. I say time machine because it hasn't been updated in 8 years basically https://github.com/EdenRidgway/gfcdock
there's also XWT, same docking issue applies I think though https://github.com/mono/xwt
IMO Avalonia looks like the best candidate.
I'm now a patreon btw :)
I meant to pay $50
but it says I'm paying $10
Ah, fixed :)
if the editor is going to be rewritten, it's important to have it easilly pluggable
and that may mean to shift from MVVM approach to an immediate UI style, like in Unity or Blender
@xen2 thanks for your efforts to open source the engine. this is how confident we are about it: https://vvvv.org/blog/vl-threedee
Hm, interesting. The LAuncher doesn't seem to like that I have VS2017 15.8 Preview instead of the main release.
Source projects open fine, so :shrug:
Updated to 3.0 today. Very easy, but strangely removed my nuget references to dapper. Just readded and it worked fine :)
@xen2 Do you have list of bug fixes in 3.0?
@makotech222 added changelog from git commits (sorry I didn't spend time to review each commit to clean it up)\nhttps://github.com/xenko3d/xenko-docs/blob/master/en/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotes.md
@xen2  any plan for IK implementation? :trollface: 
@Kenji245 nothing decided for the new roadmap yet, so no plan so far
@raizam supposedly MVVM is the \pluggable\ design because only the \View\ part of MVVM needs to be rewritten (but of course, in practice some part of the view model might need to be adjusted)
but of course, depending what kind of UI framework is chosen, it can end up being quite a different design
Doc is back online, sorry for the downtime\nhttps://doc.xenko.com/3.0/en/api/Xenko.html
@xen2 Thank you! 
Ouw yeah... Congratz to the Xenko team for this MIT'ed engine. I would say this is very cool. I can't wait to have my employee to take a play with it.
:O @xen2 so busy. Look like he has started a project on the xenko repo. Is the plan to just start based on an updated version of what was in the trello board?
not sure where is a good place to discuss/vote on issues collaboratively?
trello is good enough you think?
Well, you could at least take some of the features you have started that still need some work i.e. video, hair/skin rendering. Not sure what the best forum to discuss/vote on what features should put on there though.
Maybe look through the old issues and what is on the current trello. Start from there.  Add some of the things you really want to do. :D
I know what features/changes I would like to happen. But I best so do a lot of people. :D
long time ago I looked into ZenHub (Github with some additional features like epics), seems like MS is using it extensively nowadays
I would like to organize everything like in the trello board but doing it directly on github would avoid duplicates and need for 2 accounts
so either ZenHub or GitHub vanilla with \projects\
Yeah, I would just copy whatever you want from the current trello to github projects and close down the trello board. if that doesn't workout try something else I guess.
if nobody has anything against ZenHub (need to install a chrome/firefox extension), I'll give it a try that way
If you want help with stuff feel free to ask.  I would like to contribute in someway. I'm sure plenty of others do to. I would even do some of the boring non-coding stuff.
sure, thanks!
I will probably need a few days to decide how to organize everything but I will def. need input and help soon!
as soon as zenhub is setup, feel free to add cards (even if we don't do them right away, they can be kept for future planning)
Well I have joined ZenHub
Same
feel free to start creating epics/issues
If you are going to let anyone create EPICS. We should probably come up with a guide as to what constitutes an EPIC etc.
Though EPICS just seem to be Issues?  Does zenhub itself some how track witch issues are epics?
From my understanding, an Epic is a collection of issues that count points toward an overarching goal or milestone
Maybe we need some templates for Epics, Bugs, Feature requests.
Example being we have the build system improvement Epic, and inside that Epic we could have smaller, more compartmentalised issues like investigating improvements to data bundling, etc
Think of an Epic like a meta-issue of sorts
yes, usually it's hard to fit them in a single milestone
issues/tasks will be more concrete
but small features and fixes are fine to be done directly as issues
(we can convert issues to epic back and forth I think so probably no need to worry about it too much now)
as a side note, the ZenHub Chrome extension will work on any Chromium-based browser
`tebjan` Does it work on Firefox or does it have a dedicated website interface too? Many of my fellow colleagues use Firefox because it's open software...
@tebjan looks OK on firefox: https://www.zenhub.com/extension
ZenHub supports Chromium-based browsers and Firefox
and it works separately too: https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/xenko3d/xenko/boards?repos=136570231
what does the plugin do?
Integrates it into the GitHub repo page
as a new ZenHub tab
note: I am creating a bunch of epic/issues but not saying they will actually be done, and they're in no particular order
@tebjan yes, I like it so far!
@tebjan not sure where the issue is (private forum on your side or Xenko forums?), can you create it and copy paste the description please?
yes np, can do it then
btw, makes me remember we will have to close answerhub (too expensive); not sure if we should switch to something else (stackoverflow or custom instance of another software), or just stick with forums + github
In favor of stackoverflow. we could create a xenko tag
maybe stick to gamedev stackoverflow?
https://gamedev.stackexchange.com
and comes with some free exposure I presume
only sad thing is we'll loose existing answers, I will see if they can be transferred somewhere else so they can still be linked to.
@xen2 problem with MVVM is that models have to notify changes, and it doesn't fit well in a frame based environment
once the game is running and the editor unplugged, will the models attempt to notify changes? seems like an unnecessary overhead to me
you mean a mode where changes are scanned for every frame and UI updated accordingly?
@raizam a scanning/redraw all mode works fine for a game when you only display a few values on the screen. For an editor with hundreds (if not thousands) of object/values a notification system is actually lighter. Scanning the whole scene tree every frame
A better approach in a game environment would be to use a immediate GUI library
such as imgui or nuklear
they don't look for changes, they just rerender the whole UI each frame
For Flax Editor I use in-build Engine UI library and it does pretty well -> https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxAPI\nAll done on a C# side (rendering is on C++ side). The GUI itself is similar to WinForms in design. The performance is just great!
Also game devs can extend the editor by adding custom logic, example: https://docs.flaxengine.com/manual/scripting/tutorials/custom-editor.html
@mafiesto4 this engine looks great
@xen2 Thanks for fixing the UWP bug. I managed to build the engine and everything works fine although there where hundreds of errors and warnings. xD
@Aminator9000 good, I don't need to hurry to release this fix then
Should the roadmap link on the community page be updated to the zenhub page?
yes, it should!
BTW, if you didn't notice, website is opensource too: https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko-website
release branch is the live website
So PRs against main and you will merge to release?
yes
forgot to release Visual Studio package, it's done now
What kind of engine? It is very similar to Xenko...
https://docs.flaxengine.com/manual/graphics/lighting/sky-skybox/sky.html
Just a thought.  It appears you need a login to access boards on ZenHub. Is that a barrier we should worry about. trello lets anyone look without logging in.
@dfkeenan no way around it yet it seems, but might change later: https://github.com/ZenHubIO/support/issues/754
if everything else is good and it's the only issue we have with it, I would say it is still worth using (as we can always generate a screenshot or html static version of that board regularly)
anyway, not sure zenhub board is a good fit for a high level roadmap to show to the public, it seems more useful for dev organization and those dev will login (maybe github Milestones or some view of it are a better candidate?)
The Epics view would probably be OK. But agreed their could be better options.  
Looks like there is a REST API. Might be able to auto generate nice static web content.
https://flaxengine.com/blog/flax-facts-19-decals/
good point, I will add an issue for decals, we'll need those!
Xenko looks amazing and has the perfect license. I might just have to port my game in progess from Godot.
still lot of rough edges but hopefully with a community  we can improve things much quicker than before once everything ramps up!
esp. with feedbacks from people working on actual games with it
Would Linux and Mac support eventually be possibly with something like MoltenVK?
Linux was already there with OpenGL and Vulkan, just might need a check and few bugfixes (wasn't tested in a while, it was done at beginning of CoreCLR, things changed quite a lot since then)
MacOS yes maybe we could use MoltenVK
we had a mac port started but OpenGL proved to be quite annoying (mac version is quite old and some weird implementation details/bugs) so we put it aside
I cannot wait for an all Vulkan future for everything. Gaming golden age incoming.
Well Apple is dropping OpenGL support so I guess no real choice there. If you want to support Mac.
@xen2 If you want I can do decals in Xenko like I did for Flax (deferred decals with many blending modes)
@mafiesto4 sure, would be great! would it work with the way we are doing deferred though? (we're not fully deferred)
@dfkeenan yes quite happy they moved on to something more up to date (even though Vulkan would have been much better!)
Flax uses deferred mostly so decals can override some surface parameters like normal, roughness, etc. I'm not sure about forward pass decals but we can discuss some possibilities? Also for SSR and other passes the forward renderer outputs some useful stuff like depth/normals/roughness, we could use it
sure, let's find a way to do it, that would be great -- let me know if you have any questions concerning the rendering or need additional info (might need a refresh too, it's been a while!)
might be a good opportunity for me to start writing some doc for the rendering system too
and list what needs to be rewrote/improved
Maybe we add more nodes to Graphics compositor (eg. AO, SSR, Depth Pass) so devs could have better control over the rendering pipeline?
yes sure
I remember we wanted to move from the current \instance graph\ to something closer to a flow graph (i.e. what's usually done in visual scripting), but that's a lot of work
could you still do it with the current instance graph or that will be too difficult?
anyway, feel free to let me know what you feel would be the best way\nmaybe I'll start a gitter channel like xenko-rendering or xenko-graphics for doing some more in depth discussions
yeah, DecalsProcessor but still need to figure out how to override the surface without full gbuffer. Probably decal rendered with a forward material blended with the surface.  The drawback is that it would require calculating lighting twice for pixels used by decals + alpha blending.
twice because once for surface under decal and then for decal so it gets a shadowing like the surface it covers
ok, makes sense
BTW, if you need to output additional partial gbuffers, we have an extension mechanism to do that, it's used for SSLR, velocity buffers, etc... (not sure if it was complete or not yet when you did SSLR)
Vivien did some work there
yes, be aware it changed quite a lot before being merged from the top of my head
Additional stuff for render passes is defined here: https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/blob/master/sources/engine/Xenko.Engine/Rendering/Compositing/ForwardRenderer.cs#L236
Could be done more modular/extensible
yes for sure
need to rethink completely how we want to define the graphics pipeline at some point -- quite a lot of work
Lets follow something similar to unity3d scriptable render pipeline 
we have something quite similar already, to also be able to script the rendering pipeline (cf https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/blob/master/sources/engine/Xenko.Engine/Rendering/Compositing/ForwardRenderer.cs)
> need to rethink completely how we want to define the graphics pipeline at some point -- quite a lot of work\n\nan easier way to configure the render pipeline would be really great. from our tests, it was quite difficult to insert a custom shader into the pipelline that renders together with all other material or generates input data for them. the current option of adding custom ComputeColor shaders is not flexible enough. customizing more stages and passes in an easy way would be really great.
Is the spritesheet editor not popping up for some reason?
@jayrulez Hey. I've checked it quickly, and it doesn't work. Neither with custom spritesheet, neither with the GameMenu sample.
Funny thing is, I think it worked 1 time then stopped
Yes, It did, even few hours ago, I think.
Meanwhile.. A warm welcome from the Lead Developer of Godot Engine.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/reduzio/status/1025499701498523649
Is Game profiler working? Out of the box i got null reference exception :/
yes sorry, since I was alone and mostly focusing on the MIT, there is a bunch of stuff that are totally under-tested. I expect this should get fixed over the next few days.\nhopefully from now, next versions will be much more tested by community since beta version or github version can be distributed & tested ahead of release (and some people will fix bug by themselves right away too)
If we are going to ditch answerhub and just use forums, maybe we should consider a different forums option. Something that lets you have easier separation of questions and general chat.  
Is it possible to export stuff from answerhub so we can import it somewhere else?
I will be sad to loose all my rep points though. :(
so it looks like you can export from answerhub.
Does anyone know if Jarmo from forums visits here?
Never mind, I just decided to reply to the forum post anyways.
Hmmm, the ZenHub board says it's readonly.
Should we maybe put a Community Epic on the board with some sub issues like: migrate/decommission answerhub, public roadmap, etc.? 
Hmm, maybe I can add an issue but not move it accross the board?
ZenHub is writable only for member of the organization.
Which only @xen2 is at the moment
So I just create a normal issue through github then?
inviting as collaborator should be enough no?
I need to give write permissions it seems: https://github.com/ZenHubIO/support/issues/910
anyway, as you said, you can juste create issues and I will organize them
probably safer that way
Eventually the organisation should probably be made joinable (as Epic's is) and write given to trusted contributors to take some of the load off your shoulders, but for now this will work.
yes, I think I will have to stick with outside collaborators for now (which should give you the same rights) because I have to pay organization members per seat (I thought that if org member could only see public repo it wouldn't count as a seat, but it does)
One thing I've been meaning to ask for a while is if the engine supports loop offsets for audio (i.e. first play from the beginning, then loop back to a defined point in the stream either by time or by sample)
This is possible in Godot though I'm unsure how easy it would be to do it C# if not implemented
C# would not be the limiting factor. It would be the underlying audio APIs.
I'm mostly uninitiated when it comes to programming, forgive me for that (I'm trying though!) :P\n\nShould theoretically be possible if we can read it from tags using something like NVorbis maybe? It's easily doable with WAV but loading an entire PCM wave file into memory for each track isn't exactly cheap
Related: audio bussing. Would make managing volume on groups of SoundInstances much more straightforward.
It's been a long time since I wrote any audio code. I am pretty sure the DirectX audio APIs (XAudio2?) make that pretty easy.  I have no idea about the other platforms (linux, iphone, adroid).
OMG The XAudio2 API Documentation is woeful. 
I wrote the https://github.com/sharpdx/Toolkit/tree/master/Source/Toolkit/SharpDX.Toolkit.Audio .  I remember nothing.
Microsoft API docs being garbage? Say it ain't so!
Ah, found the metadata struct is WaveBankReader. Looks like you were at least on your way to implementing loop offset, if not already finished :P
I might stop raising issues. :eyes: 
any hints on this would be highly appreciated, can't run my previous project at the moment: https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/issues/32
I haven't even installed 3.0 yet. :grimacing: 
Oh, will the [old Xenko repository](https://github.com/SiliconStudio/xenko/) stay up for a while? There are quite a bunch of open issues there that might not have been addressed yet.
suggestion: add tags to github issues so it is easier to know what is what
Has anyone previously tried to implement Windows Mixed Reality? I'm currently fiddling around with it but it doesn't let me create a holographic space and I get a UnauthorizedAccessException.
@tebjan answered it
@RUSshy good point, I need to add a bunch of tags; any suggestion past the usual ones?
BTW, if anybody is interested to help with issues (tags, zenhub issues creation, etc...) I am fine with giving collaborator permissions so feel free to ask
@xen2 thanks, will try now
here is a list of tags we have internally as an inspiration: 5 minute action, blocks, bug, change, documentation, code, feature, enhancement, forum, high priority, performance, re:bug, rename, review, website
then we have tags for each part of the software, like the editor, runtime, langauge... but i don't know how ZenHub epics replace topics or work even better for categorizing issues
Hm... the problem seems to be that the system manages the swap chain and you don't have access to it except for presenting the current prediction. You get an exception if you create a new one for the CoreWindow.
by the system do you mean holographic or xenko?
wow, it's crazy late. I should be in bed. Laters....
@Animator9000 not sure the exact details, but I think you might want to implement a custom `GraphicsPresenter` (some mobile platforms like windows RT were similar in that swapchain was created with the window rather than ourselves)
@dfkeenan I meant the holographic space.
@xen2 I will try that.
@xen2 what is the condition that the Xenko menu from the plugin appears in visual studio? for me its sometimes present sometimes not...
@Aminator9000 I'm interested in implementing Windows Mixed Reality/HoloLens support too. Will be happy to help!
@tebjan `XenkoPackage.cs` calls this: https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/blob/master/sources/tools/Xenko.VisualStudio.Package/Commands/XenkoCommandsProxy.cs#L297 and it needs to return `LoadedPackage != null`
doesn't work well in some cases?
ah, so xenko game studio must run?
no
it will check opened project Xenko expected version with `PackageSessionHelper.GetPackageVersion`
then it will try to find a matching Xenko version installed
when i open the project from game studio its always present. but when i open the solution from the visual studio start page its not there
https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/blob/951335d9d421889a7459130f3e68436c62d8a02c/sources/assets/Xenko.Core.Assets/PackageSessionHelper.Solution.cs#L27
is it using a github version or release version from launcher?
i have the release version
[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/xenko3d/xenko/HaWh/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/xenko3d/xenko/HaWh/image.png)
is the project setup correctly like this? 
i've added the sharpdx assemblies by hand
in practice what is detected is that your .sln should have something like this:\n```\nProject(\{2150E333-8FDC-42A3-9474-1A3956D46DE8}\) = \MyGame55\ \MyGame55\ \{45DE31EB-3529-4923-9676-8BDE405FC7C4}\\n\tProjectSection(XenkoPackage) = preProject\n\t\tMyGame55/MyGame55.xkpkg = MyGame55/MyGame55.xkpkg\n\tEndProjectSection\nEndProject\n```
yes, i have this:\n```\nProject(\{2150E333-8FDC-42A3-9474-1A3956D46DE8}\) = \ComputeParticlesTest\ \ComputeParticlesTest\ \{348B4819-B3DE-44A6-A092-1C308E6BAA87}\\n\tProjectSection(XenkoPackage) = preProject\n\t\tComputeParticlesTest/ComputeParticlesTest.xkpkg = ComputeParticlesTest/ComputeParticlesTest.xkpkg\n\tEndProjectSection\nEndProject\n```\n
might be some visual studio enable disable thing then. i have seen that before...
let me know if you see a pattern
works almost, now i have null exception in the profiler
\[Game]: Error: Unexpected exception. System.NullReferenceException:\n   bei Xenko.Profiling.GameProfilingSystem.Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n   bei Xenko.Games.GameSystemCollection.Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n   bei Xenko.Games.GameBase.Draw(GameTime gameTime)\n   bei Xenko.Games.GameBase.DrawFrame()\n   bei Xenko.Games.GameBase.TickInternal()\
ok works when disabling the profiler script
Can't get UWP platform to work. Project wizard says it's not supported. I'm running from GitHub codebase on Windows10 x64. 
just the wizard saying not supported but you can create it, right?
(the detection code is broken)
yes, but then when I switch in editor and try to build it shows \Error: Platform UWP isn't supported for execution.\\n
But you can run it only from Visual Studio.
oh, I didn't try that yet
Also, set the Target and Minimum Version to the highest one.
Oh man, now the creation of the holographic space gives me a catastrophic failure and I really have no idea why. xD
@kobush you probably pressed the \run\ button rather than the \build\ button in GameStudio
yes
@kobush  concerning the wizard saying it's not supported, I created https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/issues/42
hmm, build gives me same message
does it work from visual studio?
maybe game studio uses the same broken code as the wizard to detect if build is supported
yeah. I found it tries to find this path \C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\MSBuild\\\\Microsoft\\\\WindowsXaml\\\\v14.0\\\\8.2\\\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Common.Targets\
Do you have Visual Studio 2015 or 2017?
It does't build in VS either. 
VS 2017 Enterprise v.15.7.5
It can't resolve UAP 10.0 dependencies in .Game project
Because normally it should be v15.0 instead of v14.0.
For me it only can't resolve Xenko.Video.
this path is hardcoded in XenkoConfig.cs line 21
yes but this is only for checking in the wizard
if you open your .sln with VS2017 it should still work
yea, I know it's just check for wizard. 
(could do it recently when fixing UWP)
ok sorry for the misunderstanding
```\n\c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\WindowsXaml\\v15.0\\8.1\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Common.Targets\ \n\c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\WindowsXaml\\v15.0\\8.2\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Common.Targets\ \n\c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\WindowsXaml\\v15.0\\8.21\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Common.Targets\ \n\c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Enterprise\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\WindowsXaml\\v15.0\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Common.Targets\ \n\c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\10.0.14393.0\\XamlCompiler\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Common.targets\ \n\c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\10.0.15063.0\\XamlCompiler\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Common.targets\ \n\c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\10.0.16299.0\\XamlCompiler\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Common.targets\ \n\c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\10.0.17134.0\\XamlCompiler\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Common.targets\ \n```
these are all paths for Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.Common.targets in my c:\\Program Files (x86)
thanks
Visual Studio .csproj for UWP uses something like this 
I added a comment on https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/issues/42 to describe what is probably a much more future-proof way to check if iOS, Android and UWP are available
```\n  <Import Project=\$(MSBuildExtensionsPath)\\Microsoft\\WindowsXaml\\v$(VisualStudioVersion)\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.CSharp.targets\ />\n```
@Aminator9000 What exact 'Target version' you have set?
Build 17134 which is the current April 2018 Update.
Okay. I have the same ...  did you build Game Studio from GitHub code or running binaries?
From GitHub, because the bug that caused UWP builds to throw an exception was fixed.
Does generated game project pulls dependencies via Nuget?
It is a NuGet package but it comes from the Xenko installation and not from nuget.org.
Alright. Didn't cross my mind I have to build Xenko.UWP.sln first :)
It works now.
Now to play with holographics.... I see that currently project is generated to use Xaml window. But in XenkoConfig.cs there is commented out line with CoreWindow template. 
AppContextType has UWPCoreWindow value
Any tips on how to switch to this?
Just delete all XAML and C# files and replace it with an App.cs file in which you have a class App that implements IFrameworkView and IFrameworkViewSource. In CreateView you return this and in the Run method you call Game.Run(\u2026). Finally you need have a Main method (e.g. in class Program) that calls CoreApplication.Run(new App()); That's it.
@Aminator9000 Thank you!
What is the best way to get a Xenko.Graphics.Texture from a SharpDX.Direct3D11.Texture2D?
cool to see so much life in xenko now
@Aminator9000 did you manage to initialize the HolographicSpace? 
Yes, I had to activate the CoreWindow after the call to HolographicSpace.CreateForCoreWindow(\u2026). It now switches (with the fancy animation) into exclusive mode but right now I'm stuck at converting the back buffer to a Xenko texture.
I put it in IFrameworkView.SetWindow and it that works. next is to use the supplied PrimaryAdapterId to create coresponding d3dDevice
then call             holographicSpace.SetDirect3D11Device(d3dInteropDevice);
did you find where to put this?
Yes, you have to write some interop code. Uhm\u2026 where should I best post it?
https://gist.github.com/ 
https://gist.github.com/Aminator9000/7151040c1963b20f6c3c18674973093e
thank you.
you have this in separate project or you added it inside the Xenko sln ?
Inside Xenko.sln
ahh, explains why it shows device.NativeDevice as internal
That's why you need to do it inside Xenko. For UWP specific stuff use Xeko.UWP.sln but always check if Xenko.sln also builds.
Hey! I was hoping to hop in and start helping with some issues. Is there any process (aside from Git etiquette) in place for that? n_n'
Poking my nose around adding a custom asset type to GameStudio.\n\nSo.\u2026.\nMuch.....\nHard-coding..... ;-)\n
@ahrenm Yes indeed. Adding new asset type is not completely plugable. It's been a while since I have looked at the code (left SiliconStudio almost a year ago). I'll try to write a documentation on how to add new assets and all that's needed (AssetCompiler
that would be great!
@Kryptos-FR Sweeet. I think I've got some of the broad strokes down. Currently trying to nut out how the templates get baked in. My plan is probably to implement a couple of arbitrary asset types and editors just so I understand how everything hangs toget
what does it mean if visual studio complains about \Xenko.VisualStudio.Commands\ not found?
it means it couldn't find Xenko folder with this assembly compiled in it
with a custom compiled Xenko?
if yes, you need to compile the assembly
(otherwise it's no big deal, just the Visual Studio extension won't work properly)
@ahrenm Sure. That will be a good exercise. Kindly remind me by the end of next week if I have forgotten.\nI'm quite busy at work but I'll try to get it done whenever I have time.
the reason why is, VS plugin can work with multiple version side by side so it doesn't contain most of the code\nthis VS plugin loads the code for performing action from the actual version of Xenko being used for that project\n\nthis allows us to have most of VS actions on Xenko side rather than VS plugin side (easier for maintenance/update)
maybe its related to xenko plugin now showing up thing...
@ahrenm @Kryptos-FR I remember we did some bugfixes before I left Silicon Studio to have them properly working in the editor when asset is created in user assemblies
Maybe. That was more than a year ago so my memory is a bit blurry...
hah, just built xenko for the first time and its starts up... yea.
that's enough for today... thanks for the help
https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/issues/19  It would be very cool to see visual programming! For example in Unreal Engine 4 - blueprint very good idea!
How would I achieve debugging the engine when running a game? Adding it to the Engine Solution and referencing the engine projects gives me MSBuild errors.
We had source server support in the past. @xen2 is that still enabled?
Have you got \just my code enabled\?
@Kryptos-FR I think he is talking about a self compiled Xenko
disabling just my code should work yes
if you created the game with that Xenko version (which should be 3.0.0.1-dev in your .xkpkg/csproj)
you should see Xenko references being picked up from your Xenko checkout folder, if not the case something is wrong
@didzey \n> https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/issues/19  It would be very cool to see visual programming! For example in Unreal Engine 4 - blueprint very good idea!
we are on it, first proof of concept works already: https://vvvv.org/blog/vl-threedee
our visual programming language is already available, you can download and try it: https://vvvv.org/documentation/vl
Hey guys. Have you heard of https://github.com/google/filament ?\nThere is a pretty cool documentation as well (basically a book about PBR and BRDF): https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.md.html. Could be nice to grab some stuff/ideas from it.

@debugging it doesn't pick up the symbols for some reason... but when i check the Debug->Modules window the correct assemblies have been loaded
Yep, I have the exact same problem.
@Aminator9000  the assembly Xenko.Graphics gets build into Bin\\Windows\\Directx3D11 but then loaded from Bin\\Windows that may be a hint
Hm... on Windows Desktop the symbols are found and loaded but on UWP they are not.
It searches for symbols in the AppX folder where the deployed app is but the PDB files are in the directory above. I always found it weird how it normally manages to load symbols for the .exe (when Just My Code is enabled) even though the PDB file is not in the AppX folder.
It's funny that I could debug UWP apps with VS Code when I just put the PDB file right next to the .exe. xD
What exactly do you mean?
if you press play in xenko another exe starts, the one of the game... you might need to attach the debugger to that process
I don't press play in Xenko because you can only start UWP apps from Visual Studio. There is no other executable except for the one in the AppX folder. Attaching to the process afterwards leads to the same results.
Ok, I fixed it with a post-build event that just copies the PDB files to the AppX folder. Now everything works fine. Well... no image gets rendered yet but at least no exception gets thrown and it successfully gets into the holographic space but everything is black.
Nice work :)
@Aminator9000  can you paste the post-build step command ?
if not exist \$(TargetDir)AppX\ mkdir \$(TargetDir)AppX\\ncopy \$(TargetDir)*.pdb\ \$(TargetDir)AppX\
Works. Thank you!
Oh my god
I did get something.
I can get a raw color to display. xD
did you create new type of VRDevice ?
Yes
Looks like Xenko assumes that there is a single render target Texture containing both eyes. But in Windows there is separate texture for each. Obtained via HolographicCameraRenderingParameters.Direct3D11BackBuffer
How do you get two different ones?
I just took the back buffer, wrapped it in a texture and at least clearing the buffer with a color works.
How would I get the preferred VR APIs when creating a new GraphisPresenter in GameWindowRenderer and GamePlatform? I made my own GraphicsPresenter for WMR so I need to differentiate right there. The problem is that Xenko.Games cannot reference Xenko.VirtualReality because that would cause a circular dependency.
@Aminator9000 did you see this sample https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/BasicHologram ?
Yep, that's what I am working with the whole time.
Microsoft's docs also heavily reference this sample.
Sorry, been a while  - just realized that it is not per eye but per holographic camera
Looking at CameraResources.cs
I guess for start we can assume there is only one camera 
I assume that too and it works.
So you render to HolographicCameraRenderingParameters.Direct3D11BackBuffer ?
Yes
Passing it as GraphicsPresenter.BackBuffer?
Yes
You wait for holographicSpace.CameraAdded or is there a way to iterate?
When you create a HolographicFrame you can iterate through HolographicFrame.CurrentPrediction.CameraPoses. I just take the the 0th index because I can only give back one depth buffer, although the array size is 2, which might a problem but I don't know.
When you try to throw a helpful exception but it is in a try-finally block...
It is probably early to talk about this, but does anyone have plans to launch a course of video lessons about the engine? They are very few. This is a good way to add popularity to the engine, give an incentive to study it
I would have to agree with @Toriadus on this :)
what's up @HeadClot  - you drift from engine to engine almost as much as I do
I am currently learning C#
Hence why I am here
the best language in the world imo
I would have to agree
I have a strong dislike of C++ due to the compile times
i have reservations about xenko though... it seems a bit over-engineered to me
like 100 different projects in the solution
thats a lot to maintain :S
@tebjan - Hey got a question are there any plans for a terrain system?
I disagree that it's *over* engineered- it's nicely separated by topic. Very cohesive and modular (and they're trying to make it more so via #12 and #13 ). And many of the projects are unit tests, which is refreshing imo n_n' Coming from an engine and company that uses all of 0 tests
Try compiling with .NET Native. The compilation times there can also be pretty long. (That's why it's only for release.)
@HeadClot exactly the thing i am missing too.. a terrain
@HeadClot i haven't read anything about that yet, but you can open an issue and see whether someone picks it up.
Ok will do 
@darrylryan i also disagree, it's extremely well engineered and i was surprised that building the entire solution worked out of the box
for me the solution didnt work out of the box.. i had to install a new .net framework because it doesnt work with 4.7 or core
and the fact there's a ton of projects makes it pretty hard to move it to 4.7
@tebjan So I saw that you are working on a Visual Scripting system for Xenko
Or at least you commented on it
yes
What are your plans for Visual Scripting?
Like I am curious :)
its good to see a lot of people discussing in here
hopefully enough people to make it grow :)
@HeadClot i've layed out the current status in the comment here: https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/issues/19#issuecomment-410534347
Got it :)
the visual programming language itself exists already,  you can download and try it out. we are currently investigating into workflows for users and how xenko and VL can work together.
Got it
I am reading up on this post https://vvvv.org/documentation/vl
Looks interesting
yes, we are quite happy with it so far. hit me up or join our forums/chat if you want to know more...
Sure will do! need to file this issue before I do. :)
Imo a visual shader editor would be more interesting although with Xenko's shader language you are encouraged to write shaders yourself.
@darrylryan @AirAKose the idea was indeed to have a proper separation to have a clean architecture. 
That said some separation don't necessarily make sense anymore. For example the Core projects were meant to be reused outside of Xenko; to be in a sort engine agnostic. 
But that never concretized. So later we can maybe have a look at the global solution and reorganize a bit, merging some projects together.
@Kryptos-FR I would prefer to see it so that all the design-time / test / debug bits are under one easy to remove folder
@Aminator9000 - I know that Shader forge is open source now. Maybe we could use that as a reference? 
https://github.com/FreyaHolmer/ShaderForge
so its clear which bits I actually need to care about and which are just fluff :D
The tests are in their own folders already.
yeah i just realised that
i just went through and hid them all
thats looking better already
is there any hope to get the engine working on .net core  or mono so it can run on linux/mac?
It already works on Linux with .Net Core and Mono.
ooo really? the web page doesnt say so!
that makes it a lot more interesting!
@Aminator9000 when you create a new project it asks you what platforms to target... it doesnt offer linux or mac there
@darrylryan do you work with the official download or a self compiled one?
It is currenty not available. Here is the issue #17.
@tebjan i am building the source
Anyone else get a ton of warnings when building? And would there be any problems with me cleaning up some of the easier ones?\n(like implicit conversions, duplicate imports, test cases using Assert.Equals instead of others, and signed/unsigned mismatches)
Yes, would be nice if you could.
@AirAKose if possible try to make separate commits per category of warnings (unit test, \ncode quality, etc.). That will make the review easier.
That sounds completely doable n_n
does anyone know of a terrain example for xenko?
@Kryptos-FR do you know where i have to add an ISceneRenderer if it should render together with the 'normal' xenko 3d objects into the color/depth buffer?
currently i added it to the SceneRendererCollection of the GraphicsCompositor.Game but it seems that it is too late and draws on top of everything...
the goal is to render into the color/depth buffer with custom shaders
@xen2 would know about the engine part, especially the graphics compositor.
I am not a graphics engineer. I mostly worked on the editor side ^^
ok, i redirect the question to @xen2 then...
[![CijKoV9xrE.gif](https://files.gitter.im/xenko3d/xenko/Xrxs/thumb/CijKoV9xrE.gif)](https://files.gitter.im/xenko3d/xenko/Xrxs/CijKoV9xrE.gif)
the effect looks like this now, the camera transformation of the particles is not in sync with the floor and they draw over the UI buttons
basically its (Game.SceneSystem.GraphicsCompositor.Game.Child as SceneRendererCollection).Add(myISceneRenderer) but i have the feeling that there might be a better option to render with custom shaders...
@tebjan how much are you customizing? directly drawing with low level API?
yes, basically a draw call in the right moment with the right backbuffers to run the shaders on is what i am looking for
@tebjan you can inherit from `RootRenderFeature` if you really want to be part of the main scene drawing, but be aware that it might be little bit of work
but this will give you the most flexibility
i am ok with a bit of work, becaus i only have to do it once... is there any similar class i can look into? and how do i add the RootRenderFeature to the game then?
you can take a look at `BackgroundRenderFeature` for a simple example
ah, i just saw that i tried that already back in april but didn't succeed... i'll give it another go then. i might be back with more specific questions... tomorrow. thanks a lot so far!
do i need to define my own render objects and so on for that?
then what you will need is:\n- add it to your graphics compositor (left pane, there's a list of render features)\n- somehow add a `RenderObject`of the matching type to the list of `VisibilityGroup.RenderObjects` (you can take a look at `BackgroundRenderProcessor` for example -- this one add a single object and keep it in this list since we draw only a single background, while for example others such as `MeshRenderProcessor` add many of them, one per mesh)
you can also notice the `[DefaultEntityComponentRenderer(typeof(BackgroundRenderProcessor))]` on `BackgroundComponent`
(of course, if you don't have a backing component, nothing prevent you to fill `VisibilityGroup.RenderObjects` from some other place)
ah... i remember that i got something showing up there already, i also added it to the compositor but something wasn't working
sorry that it's not yet as easy as it hopefully should be someday
ok, i'll dig into it
no problem, thanks for the help... later
those API might change later down the road (but not for a while, it will take time to make this layer more accessible)
added teamcity badges: https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/edit/master/README.md\ntoo many builds, might have to switch column and rows\nI plan to make teamcity available to guest login soon
Hi, never knew this site existed, found it looking for help.\n\nI dont want to ask a question that has been asked many times, I scrolled through and didn't see it.\nSo my question is, I got the source code for xenko, and followed the steps on github for building the source, but when I build the entire solution I get a bunch of errors about missing .dlls, I installed the installer and installed the VS plugin from there, and I still get errors about missing dlls, all the dlls that are missing are supposed to be in the \\dir\\Bin\\Windows folder, not sure if that helps any, so how would I make sure these dlls get included when I build the source?
I've hit that too n_n' For me, the solution was to change the \Solution Platform\ from \Mixed Platforms\ to \Win32\. I assume one of the target configurations is iffy
Ohh I'll try that, I can't believe I didn't think of that 
Make sure you have git lfs installed and properly setup. Otherwise you'll be missing some binaries
Compiling from \Mixed Platforms\ works fine for me, expect one test project. But that can be ignore for now. I'll look into that one later.
Switching to win32 still gives same errors.\nI downloaded and installed git lfs, but is there specific things I must to post install?
To see if git lfs worked fine, go to the deps folder and see if any dll look fine: if opening the dll with a text editor shows some plaintext then it means that git lfs didn't work properly. Otherwise it's fine.
Just in case you can run git lfs fetch --all and see if it downloads some file or show errors
Also to be able to build the whole solution,  you need to have installed support for C++ and the windows 10 sdk in Visual Studio 2017. @xen2 we should precise the different prerequisites for running Xenko (same as installer) and building it.
I opened a dll in Notepad++ and it's black blocks with a letters inside, so I guess its fine.\nIll try running \nI have the windows 10sdk, and C++ support, I was writing C++ code before this so that's all good
so I ran fetch all, and 1545 objects have been found
I rebuilt the solution, and same issues
OK can you show one of the error log here?
I sometimes have some build order issues. So I first build Core, then Runtime (eventually Native first). And then the whole solution. Subsequent build should be fine as most dll/binaries are already in the bin folder.
@xen2 I wonder if build order issue could be related to the new project file format?
```\nSeverity\tCode\tDescription\tProject\tFile\tLine\tSuppression State\nError\tMSB3030\tCould not copy the file \E:\\dev\\git\\xenko\\Bin\\Windows\\x86\\libcore.dll\ because it was not found.\tXenko.GameStudio.Tests\tE:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Community\\MSBuild\\15.0\\Bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets\nError\tMSB3030\tCould not copy the file \E:\\dev\\git\\xenko\\Bin\\Windows\\x64\\libcore.dll\ because it was not found.\tXenko.GameStudio.Tests\tE:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Community\\MSBuild\\15.0\\Bin\\Microsoft.Common.CurrentVersion.targets\n```
Several variants of that error about the missing dll. The .lib was generated, but I don't see that dll except deep in the .shadow folder
Does xenko generate an error log somewhere? can't seem to find it
But yeah all my errors are the different varients of that image, but it's Editor, Assets, Core packages, FBX importer, game studio, it looks like basically everything I need to use the engine lol
So when I build in any CoreCLR, it generates the `libcore.dll`. Any other configuration clears it
rofl, the UWP and iOS Team City badges so small.
I have libcore.dll too
shocking I have a dll :'D
@AdamJDrysdale_twitter Are you doing a Rebuild by chance?..
I rebuilt the source like 6 times today
end up with same results everytime
unless you mean rebuild the solution, I did that few times too, nothing is working
Yeah... Try just rebuilding the `Xenko.Core` project in `10-CoreRuntime`. Then do normal \Build\ on the whole solution
does anyone know any free IK solver which is easy to be implemented?
okay Ill try it
I rebuilt xenko.core project, and then built the solution, I still ended up with the same 42 failed
Is this e c o n o m y at work :D
oh I had 0 failed with xenko.core, I should add
Libcore and libnative seem to be causing some build order issues. If you have any of those appearing in log, try to build them first separately.
I think the issue is that they are indirect references and somehow either our projects don't indicate to MSBuild that they are required or MSBuild incorrectly believes that they are already up to date.
Gotcha. on my box, doing a rebuild on any Core projects deletes `libcore.dll`, and only `Xenko.Core` generates it, so that makes sense n_n'
I searched the solution for both those files, I don't have either
I checked the folder that has the specific dlls, and I do actually have the files, so Vs just needs to find them somehow
Did you set up the environment variable?
Yes
I named the variable \XenkoDir\ just like the github instruction said to, and the value is \C:\\xenko\ 
Re cloning the source and trying to build again
Wich version of visual studio you have ?
2017
@HeadClot  \Hey got a question here too any plans for a terrain system?\ -  I'm also concerned about this issue, in unity with this there are some problems
I rebuilt the source now I have 3 failed instead of 49 WOO!
progress
Eyy, nice (bn_n)b Are the errors at least different?
Rebuilding solution to check
@dfkeenan swapped columns/rows, badges should be better now
39 success 0 failed now
But new issue, I can't debug editor or other things an error message pops up.\nhttps://gyazo.com/d6f9d7029688e3d671b7a710ec4b2407
@AdamJDrysdale_twitter just fixed it: https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/issues/61
(select `60-Editor\\XenkoGameStudio` as startup project -- this will be automatic with latest version too for users that never opened the .sln yet)
The project manager popped up, Thank you so much
I'm curious what is everyone timezone. @xen2 and myself are in Japan so that's UTC+9. Could be nice to know if we plan to do some weekend code jam or Skype call. We could organize team per region of the world (that's probably premature at the moment until the community grows significantly).
For me it is CEST
@matrixbot Just turn off Just My Code. For UWP projects always copy the PDB files into the deployment folder (e. g. with a post-build event).
Just start it from Visual Studio.
Ah, you start the game... But will breakpoints be hit in the xenko solution then?
yes if they're set in the Visual Studio debugging the game
BTW there was this feature that generate PDB for official release that should point to github
I will need to double check if it's still working/activated
(Visual Studio can automatically download files from there and debug those)
hm, doesn't seem to work... i've copied all xenko .dlls and .pdbs from the xenko-dev\\Bin folder to the Game\\Bin\\Windows\\Debug folden. then i start the game exe and attach the debugger... under Debug->Modules the right assemblies have been loaded but it says it cannot find or open the pdb files.
trying to fix this one: https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/issues/41
You don't need to copy anything on Windows Desktop.
the project was created and built with the official xenko
maybe i have to reference xenko 3.0.0.1-dev nuget instead of xenko in the game project...
Yes, you need to reference xenko 3.0.0.1-dev.
ah nice, xenko adds local nuget package sources...
so i exchanged the nuget packages in the game solution, but now the asset compiler complains
[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/xenko3d/xenko/xvNF/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/xenko3d/xenko/xvNF/image.png)
do i need to exchange the xenko .xkpkg package in game studio somehow as well? and how do i do that?
Ok, I go a bit further. I actually got the scene to render in Windows Mixed Reality but only because I didn't enable VR, so it ignores head movement and only renders to the left eye.
Good progress nonetheless!
Ok, I see the problem. When drawing in VR the ForwardRenderer the render target is deifferent with a different format (R16G16B16A16_Float instead of B8G8R8A8_UNorm and B8G8R8A8_UNorm_SrRgb without post-processing effects). I just need to draw to the back buffer of the GraphicsPresenter.
@kobush Windows Mixed Reality now actually works with head movement and is runs super smooth. I still need to figure out how to get the buffer for the right eye from the back buffer tho.
@Aminator9000  so if you look in SpinningCubeRenderer you will notice that it uses instancing to render to both buffers in single call
optionally this can also use the SV_RenderTargetArrayIndex if supported (see flag usingVprtShaders)
but you can actually render it one by one
both back buffer and depth buffer are actually texture arrays
you can see this in CameraResources.cs line 129, 140
So do I need to write a custom shader?
not necesserly
this is recommended because it's faster but will require to rewrite all shaders
see here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/rendering-in-directx
* Stereo rendering is recommended to be accomplished using instanced drawing to a render target array. The holographic app template uses the recommended approach of instanced drawing to a render target array, which uses a render target view onto a Texture2DArray
* If you want to render without using stereo instancing, you will need to create two non-array RenderTargetViews (one for each eye) that each reference one of the two slices in the Texture2DArray provided to the app from the system. This is not recommended, as it is typically significantly slower than using instancing.
See the answer here: https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/15097/render-to-texture2darray-slices-in-directx11 
Trying to figure out how to map this to SharpDX:
```\nD3D11_RENDER_TARGET_VIEW_DESC desc;\ndesc.ViewDimension = D3D11_RTV_DIMENSION_TEXTURE2D;\ndesc.Texture2D.MipSlice = D3D11CalcSubresource(0, arraySlice, mipLevels); \n```
Ok, I will try that.
I hope this will work https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45018143/in-sharpdx-how-can-i-draw-to-a-single-texture2d-from-a-texture2d-array
this actually refers to WMR :)
@kobush I can't figure out where the forward renderer switches between render target views and where I could set them. When post-processing is on (without it I just get the clear color) it seems that it takes the whole buffer and renders to each half but 
does xenko have a LOD system?
i cant see how you set the LOD distances 
not at all
thats a shame
Gotta do it the old fashion way?
here is a snipped for model LOD: https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/issues/37
That actually doesn't look too complicated
Xenko has too many (useless) projects/assemblies
@mafiesto4 is it a huge task to implement in Xenko?
I hope to see soon a road map to understand what things will be implemented in the engine
Yeah I'm looking forward to that, on twitter I saw some talks about a roadmap.... I think? lol
@Aminator9000 I don't think that is possible (combine two buffers into one). But I think another option might be to create another buffer double width and let ForwardRenderer use it as expected. Then at the end of make copy from this into texture array yo
Perhaps this could be done in your GraphicsPresenter.EndDraw
I also tried using the two RenderTargetViews but I can't find a way to make Xenko.Graphics.Textures out of them.
i cant even get the latest master of xenko to build
i'm getting weird errors about nuget compression
I gave up on xenko when I was asked to setup .NET 4.6.2 :p
i did that bit.. it was working yesterday
Why is that a showstopper @raizam ?
something broke now
@jayrulez you shouldnt really have to install a specific framework version to run a .NET project... usually you can just retarget
but xenko is so sprawling it makes it tricky to do so :S
I'm pretty sure those kinks will get ironed out in the future.
also I'd like Xenko to be light, there are just way too many unecessary .csproj/assemblies
That can be cleaned up too.
@xen2 mentioned elsewhere that the flexibility they envisioned with that fine grained separation did not materialize...
So I believe they will clean that up eventually and make the dev env leaner.
Ideally, the whole thing can be in 3 or 4 layers
I would love it it were structured like Banshee.
You'd have a lower level framework comprised of core utilities, core abstractions and the core engine and above that the editor.
yep
flexibility comes at a cost of maintability
imo its usually better to keep everything as simple and flat as possible unless you have a specific use case in mind
abstracting and splitting things up for the sake of flexibility and being able to swap stuff out just adds more layers of wtf and tons of configs on top
@jayrulez I think it's not so hard to add LODs (even sth like the proposed script) but it also should add some proper tooling like previewing LODs, LODs debugging viewport, LOD transition, LOD for skinned models and animations and many other improvements 
and billboard lods, generaing lods, lod distance, lod bias, per platform lod bias..
I don't understand why people complain about the number of DLLs. You know it has no impact on performance. For once it makes the architecture cleaner and more flexible.
The .Net framework itself is split on lot of assemblies. Or do you pretend that Microsoft engineers don't know what they are doing?
@Kryptos-FR it makes it harder to read and maintain tho
each one is a bunch of config files and settings to deal with
and the solution gets heavy
looking for flexibility for no reason increases the number of layers, it affects performance of course
@darrylryan on the contrary. Having a proper separation of concern makes maintenance easier. It makes the type less coupled.
Number of assemblies and number of layers are not directly related. You can have 100 of assemblies and still only have 3 or 4 layers. That's the case with .net framework for instance.
That said they are some separation (esp. In the core assemblies) that don't necessarily make sense anymore. But looking to reduce the assemblies should not be the driving reason. You must have a proper incentive to merge assemblies with scenario that won't be possible otherwise.
It is always easier to merge assemblies that to split them. So a good design is to properly separate first and then figure out if some should be merged when you have more insight on how everything is working together.
For that reason I don't believe that the community should focus on refactoring at the moment. Get a god understanding of everything first. Make some fix or minor changes. And only after that with all the knowledge and experience you have gathered cab we think of changing the architecture. 
That's my opinion anyway.
separation of concern is good practice, having a decoupled architecture is fine if it doesn't introduce extra runtime indirections
another approach would be to use shared project `.shproj` which gets merged in the assembly
but overall Xenko looks nice, thank you for open sourcing it :smiley_cat: 
totally agree with @Kryptos-FR, i also was a bit overwhelmed by the solution at first, but after a few days it didn't matter anymore. and the precious open source man power is much better spent elsewhere. for example documentation, video tutorials, fixes, template projects and so on...
Making have less assemblies/projects would not reduce the amount of code.  You would just end up with more folders in fewer projects. It would not make it any easier to find anything.
To be honest, I want to have a proper plugin system before starting to merge assemblies (at least for the editor side). I think that task would be a good opportunity to find out if the current architecture stands or if some refactoring is needed. In general I prefer to have refactoring being driven by a specific task instead of doing it for the sake of refactoring.
@dfkeenan lots of projects does makes visual studio slower though
Agreed, I think the highest priorities is breaking up the 1 NuGet package. And making a proper plugin system.  Making it easier to maintaitn/customize. Being able to add custom editors/assets without build from source would be great.
That's a good subject to discuss anyway. Sorry to sound a bit rigid on that one. We could start a discussion in the forums. I admit that some areas could be simplified or that some abstraction might not be needed. But that's a case by case.
Would be nice if in the future we could use various techniques to reduce the size of the output though. Like IL Linker to reduce size and possibly ILMerge to merge assemblies.  Reducing distribution size would be great.  Reducing the number of assemblies probably only helpful on desktop. Giving someone a single exe or a few assemblies and a data file with the assets in it is a lot nicer then giving them a zip with a sea of assemblies in it and they have to try and find the exe.
@kobush Windows Mixed Reality now works perfectly for both screens but only without post-processing.
@Kryptos-FR @dfkeenan so you would agree to put #12 and #13 as quite high priority on the roadmap then?
(at least part of them)
YES!
If support .net core, there is CoreRT we can use for distributing single AOT compiled native executable https://github.com/dotnet/corert/
they have sample for monogame https://github.com/dotnet/corert/tree/master/samples/MonoGame
yes, for some projects it would be great to install xenko just as nugets and decide by the choice of nugets which parts of xenko you use.
@xen2 At the very start a serious discussion about it and do a proper plan. I'm not sure if actual implementation would be high priority but the discussion about it should be so that we know exactly where we are going. It could have impact on other architectural change we do
Ideally I'd like to be able to split the work into smaller tasks that could be handled by different people.
ok, what I suggest is:\n- create 3 labels, `roadmap-ShortTerm` `roadmap-MediumTerm` `roadmap-LongTerm` that can be used for Epics and their tasks (not using milestones since being an OSS project based on volunteers, it depends on people actually willing to do the tasks and depend on motivation)\n- a board view with Epic and those three labels should give us a rough roadmap\n- of course, Epic will need to be split down into actual work tasks as actual implementation starts\n- once somebody assign a task to himself, only then we can have a better idea of when it might finish and assign it a tentative milestone version
sounds good? any suggestions?
Sounds reasonable to me.
sounds good, also such a the system can be improved over time...
Definitely, it's something for now. As people hop in, any issues will be easier to spot and fix
Anyone else have issues with opening the spritesheet editor?
 looks like it: https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/issues/38
Ah okay.
@Aminator9000 Thats awesome! Congratulations.
congrats @Aminator9000 !
@Aminator9000 You going to commit that to xenko?
Super excited as I use Windows MR as well :)
@xen2 I have Xenko installed. The XenkoDir env variable is now set to C:\\Program Files\\Xenko\\. I want to compile Xenko from D:\\Xenko\\xenko. If I change the env variable to match the second one will it affect my current Xenko installation?
When launching editor, it overrides it with current path so you're covered
it was mostly useful when opening VS directly (as opposed to opening VS from GameStudio), so that VS could locate Xenko
but even that should be almost not needed anymore now that we use nuget package and redirections
so I think you should be fine either way, let me know if you run into a situation where it doesn't work as expected
I will check again if not setting the env variable is OK, it's likely not needed anymore
Okay. No problem.
I'll see if I can figure out what is up with the spritesheet editor.
Checking out the source is failing :| likely due to my horrible internet connection
Hmmm, this still references Silicon Studio https://doc.xenko.com/latest/en/manual/files-and-folders/cached-files.html
That path would have changed, no?
Doing a quick search there are about 130 references to \Silicon\ in the doc repository.
Pull-request welcome :smile: 
@HeadClot Yes, but I still need to fix some things. You will now also be able to use the touchpads and thumbsticks separately.
The VR sample also works but the positioning right now is quite off.

Woot! Added a new arbitrary asset type to Xenko and GameStudio. Now to build an editor for it.
Then do it a few more times and document the process. :-)
YAY
Thank you @Aminator9000 :)
I get an NullException everytime I try to call this.GetSimulation() from new games that I create. Adding the \Debug Physic Shapes\ script and pressing Ctrl-Shift-P also crashes my game with a NullException. Any pointers as to why this might happen?
Do you load any physics stuff from assets? i.e. Does you scene have any colliders etc. in it. There used to be a bug (may still exist) that the physics stuff didn't initialize if you didn't.
@ahrenm very cool!
Yeah my scene does have colliders (nothing loaded from assets though)
[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/xenko3d/xenko/f9oJ/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/xenko3d/xenko/f9oJ/image.png)
Some projects seem to reference the same csproj multiple times.
Is it okay to remove one of such and submit as a pull request?
And if so, which one to remove? ../../../sources/... or ../../core... ?
@xen2 @Kryptos-FR ?
any hints on what's the bast way to give xenko as an offline installer to someone? we'll be on a very weak internet the next few days
You could download the installer and copy it to a USB 
Ahh.. so many warnings when building
@AdamJDrysdale_twitter  the installer downloads xenko from the internet, what i would need is the package that its downloading
Oh, I didn't use the installer so I wasn't sure how that worked, thought it was just like a regular installer rather than a hub or something
i guess i just zip the xenko package from my .nuget folder. but is there a list of other prerequisites for xenko to run and build? like the vs2017 build tools...
The build tools come with the source code in the tools folder, maybe just get the source code instead, there is an .exe for the game studio in \\bin\\windows folder, you do need vs2017 installed with .net stuff, uwp and C++ section
To what should I by default map the VR ABXY buttons on the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers? I thought maybe:\n\nA: Right half of right touchpad\nB: Left half of right touchpad\nX: Left half of left touchpad\nY: Right half of left touchpad\n\nOr some variation of that.
I started a new project with third person template, and when I change values in the Camera code for mouse rotation, it doesn't do anything when I build and play
Oh jeez, nvm, It's not in the code you change it, but on the property, I overlooked it... but if anyone else had the same issue here is the fix? lol
My first pull request :-O https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/pull/78/commits
nice one
Yep. I want to clean up some of these warnings and errors when building some of the projects but I will wait for @xen2 or @Kryptos-FR to be available for some guidance first.
@jayrulez I saw the same references issues and already had a fix bit I did not push it yet. Basically both reference path are kind of incorrect. You can fix it by either editing the csproj directly or removing both and adding back a reference to the core 
Wow..  Looks like I need to get started building the Xenko source myself.. I could try to add the feature enumerated values in the 
(... unbearable suspense...)
@jayrulez @Kryptos-FR  I think references are now transitive with the new project system, so it's likely most `ProjectReference` could actually be removed (but not sure yet, there might still be some issues with how we copy native libs around requiring it
@xen2 What do we do with the .targets file? They seem to introduce some reference indirection as well. Also I'm wondering what is the reason most projects get recompiled when starting the GameStudio from VS. If the last build is up to date it should start
I was planning to review, simplify and get rid of the major part of those targets with #12
OK.  Good.
Added those to the epic desc
also one additional idea was to use `TargetFrameworks` making possible to cross compile many platforms from a single solution
Are there any resources on creating custom components/processors/systems? I'm looking through the source code trying to make a simple `hello world` type deal, but I keep getting crashes.
yea, code snippet for minimal engine setup would be great
Maybe I'm making an incorrect assumption. Does behavior have to be defined in scripts inheriting from `AsyncScript` or `SyncScript`? I would rather define my own `EntityComponent`s and systems, ECS style.
You can make your own `EntityComponent`s and `EntityProcessor`s.
What is this plugin that I have to install to see the epics and such?
Zen Hub
I hope is works for Opera because I'm married to that browser :|
eh. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be available for Opera.
Just go on the zenhub website then
Whats the difference between EntityProcessors and GameSystems? Do I need to use both?
EntityProcessors are specificly designed for updating/drawing EntityComponents where as GameSystems are just generic systems that can do anything in the update/draw phases.
I see, thanks
EntityProcessors let you loop over the entites/components that you are interested without the overhead of searching the entire scene.
Okay, and with Systems you have to search the scene?
Or have a reference to what you want I guess
yeah
But you can use both together too. So for example if you look at the `ScriptProcessor` vs the `ScriptSystem`.
Does it make sense to have a nightly distribution that can be installed from the launcher?
I've been looking at the PhysicsComponent/Processor/System but its a little complicated.
@jayrulez if i remember correctly you can install chrome extentions on opera
@jayrulez https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/
Ah nice. Thank you.
It works
hey @xen2  i messaged you directly about that msbuild issue
thanks!
does xenko compiles to .net core ? how much work would be needed?
@raizam it did a while ago but we didn't update to work with recent versions
it was released in July 2016 w/ Linux support, .NET Core 1.1 was not even released
are there any reason to stick with .NET 4.6?
cause my hard drive is full and intalling .NET 4.6.2 bothers me... so I still haven't tried xenko :)
Xenko runtime can compile to .NET Core but editor and tooling is still .NET 4.6
right, I remember now. that is a good reason indeed
I think they plan to have WPF on .NET Core at some point, we might reconsider then
WPF on .NET Core will not be cross platform
So if we have cross platform aspirations we should really be looking elsewhere.
Of course any of that would be in the distant future
@xen2 how long will it be before 3.0.0.2 is available in the installer for download?
.net core 3.0 plan to have winform + wpf
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/07/net-core-3-and-support-for-windows-desktop-applications/
on windows only
yes
which is weird to me because why not just use the full framework in that case
Maybe they want to deprecate full framework and work on .NET core only.
.NET core does have quite a few advantages over full framework.
.NET Framework 4.8 is announced in thew same post
Yep but nothing new really.
While Core gets all the good stuff.
Exactly.
@jayrulez I was checking about #47 before release but looks like it doesn't impact binary release, only github build so I will go ahead with release soon, just testing it quickly
Thanks @xen2 .. Waiting for the release since I cannot build from source on this computer..
 Already a new version after just one week of MIT. Nice work, community :tada: !!
(even if it's just bug fixes)
pushing it now
might take a while, packages are much bigger since we removed 7z compression
@Kryptos-FR BTW, for the about=>backers, I wanted to make the markdown area with a slightly darker background but it seems it takes its background style property from the flowdocument which come from `Theme.xaml` `<Style x:Key=\{x:Static local:XamlMarkdow
I wasn't sure how to override it just for the about page
(btw if you have any other idea than darker background I am fine with it, I just wanted to make it clear it's a separate scrollable area, right now it has same background as the window and no border)
> pushing it now
I'll open an issue, nothing urgent
Exciting!
@adamdusty right now it's only firing up the azure VM that will do that
BTW, I moved all our build servers which were a few physical machine at SSKK to Azure so that I can later easily add number of VM by just changing a number
should scale much better and no need to host them at home
@xen2 Don't remember exactly how the styling works for the Markdown FlowDocument. I'll have a look at it this evening after work.
thanks (and no hurry anyway, I wouldn't say it's high priority)
should be pushed
@xen2 You mentioned before the possibility of releasing the installer under a non-MIT license. Is that still a possibility right now?

Project loading seems to be failing with 3.0.0.2
Not sure if this is just happening for me or if it is general.
Can someone else check please
Can you kill any Xenko.* process to make sure please?
More specifically the execserver one
I seem to have a bunch of GameStudio processes hanging around
not sure why
Do all the process names start with Xenko?
Still failing to load.
Does project loading depend on the connection router?
I notice it is not running
and if I start it from the exe then it just dies
What's the error?
When you load or create a project?
I try to load an existing project
No error
It just hangs here
Hmm, I had it one time then couldn't reproduce so I assumed it was something else with my dev env
Please create new project once then try again
So it loads eventually
But it took like 5 minutes
Ho...
Is next time faster?
Trying now
Any message in the load log?
A warning about a locked file?
No. It was just blank.
I was about to grab a screenshot then it loaded
Once it worked after 5 min there was no log?
Or it disappeared maybe if no error...
Yes, but it went away too quick for me to see
Info logs
not error
I see
Do the logs get saved to the file system?
It loads fast the second time around
I will try with another old project
I'll try to see if i can repro by making a test 3.0.0.3
Could either be locked files or maybe it downloading some nuget packages
Must have been nuget package I guess.
It happened to me too
It pops up a message asking to upgrade from 3.0.0.1 to 3.0.0.2 after
Before
It works fast for another old project now
Ok, same as it did to me theb
It's weird not seeing anything in the loading windows with that long of a wait though
Maybe it should indicate that packages are being downloaded if that is what is happening
Oh I think I know why
since the projects were 3.0.0.1
It downloaded 3.0.0.1 packages before loading the project
Ha, good point!
The Xenko update from 3.0.0.1 to .2 had removed the 3.0.0.1 stuff
Probably what is happening since we might run a restore before loading
Yes since new xenko is real nuget package, 
[![image.png](https://files.gitter.im/xenko3d/xenko/8tjE/thumb/image.png)](https://files.gitter.im/xenko3d/xenko/8tjE/image.png)
it can open project with a non installed xenko from VS and automatically dl/restore the appropriate version
Ah yes.
Of course i need to adjust the load workflow
I won't be able until later tonight though
No problem.
Thanks for the hint, can avoid some debug time
and difficult repro
@xen2 Did you saw Wave Engine editor? it uses GTK with docking lib and it works cross platform
Making the editor cross platform is not just about the UI (I would say that's on 20% of the task). You have to also migrate all the logics to the new UI system. And on top of that there is the build system itself. We rely on tools and API that for some are either only available on Windows or that are different on other platforms (e.g. FBX importer, MSBuild,  etc.). So to have a xplat editor we also need to migrate/replace all those tools with the risk of having lots of regressions. Given that the gaming market is mostly on Windows anyway.  I think the cost largely outweights the benefits. And that's before considering the size of the community, how many people are ready to support the editor on all those platforms,  etc.
So OK.  We know some of you would like to have a xplat editor. But at the moment it is not possible.
It's probably best to polish the current Windows experience anyway
@Kryptos-FR I agree with you, just was adding the idea :)
Sure. Not hard feeling :)
I just think that we should pause that discussion and focus on other area before.
Get the core up to speed before worrying too much about porting the editor
Who knows, by the time we're far enough along there might be a viable cross-platform framework for us to use
The only case where it would make sense to consider another UI
 Is if suddenly Microsoft drops WPF entirely or there is another UI that even on Windows would bring benefits (lots of).
Or we finally have a better UI system in Zeno itself (the graal is running the editor as a game with xenko's own UI).
*Xenko dawn auto correction
Zeno in autocorrect
cant tell if DB fan or just coincidence
OMG Zeno has Xenko's logo
Hello dears!) What happens?  bring me up to date)
but yeah, ideally the best way would be to use the engine's UI system for the editor, but that presents another challenge: making it feel native

AHAHAHAHAHA
ahah
it's cute
\cute\ is one way of describing the king of all universes
what is added in the new version? 3.0.0.2
Every commits since August 2nd. So that's mostly bug fixes related MSBuild I think. The rest will be invisible to end users.
And the list of backers in the about page.
We are just getting started. Hopefully next versions will contain more and more changes :smiley: 
as an example major change, might be worth looking in to lightmapping for lower-end machines / games that don't necessarily need fully dynamic lighting
We have light probes. Don't know if it's good for low end, but that's a kind of light mapping. 
(I am no graphics engineer. I mostly worked on the editor)
Could possibly bake down to static from that too
What is best way to create a scene programatically ?
https://gist.github.com/RUSshy/3aeda1630f3b0bafd471996c4765f20d but my system process entity only once
And i also get this: ```[SceneCameraRenderer]: Warning: SceneCameraRenderer [76fe87cf-f574-4ad6-85b8-e9a9586be0e2] has no camera assigned to its Slot[Main]. Make sure a camera is enabled and assigned to the corresponding Slot.```
I can't find how to do that in the doc
You need at least on entity with a camera component in your scene. Then you need to assign that camera to the graphics compositor (or maybe it is able to find it itself I don't remember). Code such as the following should help (not tested, from memory):\n```\nvar sceneRenderer = Game.EditorSceneSystem.GraphicsCompositor.Game as SceneCameraRenderer;\nsceneRenderer.Camera.Camera = cameraComponent; // from your entity\n```
Actually I copied the code from the editor so `EditorSceneSystem`is incorrect here.
And also the graphics compositor could be more complex, so casting to `SceneCameraRenderer` is not guaranteed here. Maybe the following code is better (I'll let @xen2 correct me):\n```\nvar slot = Game.SceneSystem.GraphicsCompositor.Cameras[0];\nslot.Camera = cameraComponent;\n```
Hmm. Looks like the property is not writable. In that case doing it the other way around:\n```\nvar slot = Game.SceneSystem.GraphicsCompositor.Cameras[0];\ncameraComponent.Slot = slot.ToSlotId();\n```
Should be something close to that. Good luck :D
Anyway. Good point @RUSshy : we need at least one sample that is not editor-based and where everything is done programatically.

I've always though the completely headless implementation of Xenko was one of it's selling points. Makes it a strong choice for embedding in other applications and what not.
@Kryptos-FR TY! i'll write documentation when i finish it, but my english is not very good so i'll need help for correcting words :p
Maths question: If I get the angular velocity as a Quaternion but I need it as a Vector3, how do I get it?
I think but I'm not sure. I need the implement the HeadAngularVelocity from the VRDevice class.
@RUSshy Awesome. Sure we can review it. I'd glad to help.
Public service announcement:\nDo not open the Xenko solution in Blend and accept the one way project 'upgrade'.\nThat is all.\n
The problem is that it is an abstract property so I need to implement it as a Vector3.
Never open anything in Blend. :fire: 
I'll just use the YawPitchRoll property of the quaternion.
I can't set the camera to the cameraslot because the set property is internal https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/blob/master/sources/engine/Xenko.Engine/Rendering/Compositing/SceneCameraSlot.cs#L37
should i send a PR to remove the internal ?
Or i just add a constructor ?
The CamererProcessor, binds the camera to slots
i am not sure if i understand
ohh
i misread @Kryptos-FR message
@RUSshy To be honest I haven't looked at Xenko code for more than 8 months. So there is lot that I have to learn again. Don't take my code for granted. But it should give you an idea of what is needed.
it worked :)
@Aminator9000 I got it running on HoloLens. Looks great :-)
@kobush Do you use an emulator or do you have a real one?
A real device
Nice
I have never tried it with the emulator. (I would need to upgrade to Win10 Pro to get Hyper-V.) I am almost done and can probably commit today.
Would be great to compare our implementations
Did you implement controllers as well?
no, HoloLens doesn't have them - but I will implement hand tracking
The API is mostly the same for both except for controller specific things like touchpads and thumbsticks.
Cool. So I hope we can just reuse it. Did you implement this as TouchController ?
Yes
Than I will deal with spatial mapping 
One more VR platform to support https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2XQHLSuETs&feature=youtu.be 
does anyone here ever try using Bepu Physics with xenko? i saw it have IK
@kobush I'm done adding Windows Mixed Reality support (it can and should of course be improved). Should I open a pull request now?
Awesome. Sure I will be glad to test it.
I just upgraded a stupid test game I did last year in Xenko through the editor
it went surprisingly well
Only needed to change one line in a script to get everything working again
@xen2 I saw that xenko audio is written in native code and pinvoked, what do you think about having the graphics code as native as well? Probably opengl will perform better in and less dependency for d3d11, d3d12 or vulkan 
Updated to latest codebase and got this strange behavior. If I rebuild entire Xenko.UWP solution then libcore.dll will briefly appear in folders but then is deleted. Have to manually build Xenko.Core project. Anyone else has observed this ?

@Kryptos-FR  Nice, that means someone is really waiting for the update 
When I'm defining a custom component, do I have to use the `DefaultComponentProcessor` attribute or will the entity be processed as long as the components meet the processor requirements?
